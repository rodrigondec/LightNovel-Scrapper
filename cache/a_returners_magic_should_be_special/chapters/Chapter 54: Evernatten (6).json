    "<p>[The Vagrant Problem: Progress Rate 12%]</p>",
    "<p>The number of vagrants in Evernatten was unsustainable. Felonies such as burglary and even murder were becoming daily occurrences. Residents were afraid to leave their houses, in fear of the unwelcome guests. Due to the growing instability, merchants refused to pass through Evernatten, crippling its economy.</p>",
    "<p>The atmosphere in the meeting was chilly. Lord Wilhelm Evernatten and his \u201cthink tank,\u201d Knight-Captain Ajest, Knight Eyulan, and his advisor Desir Arman had gathered to again discuss the vagrant problem.</p>",
    "<p>Eyulan, who was strongly in favor of expelling the vagrants, spoke first. \u201cThere are too many of them, my liege. On top of that, they\u2019ve begun mistaking our goodwill and generosity as some sort of obligation.\u201d She spat out the last word venomously. Unsurprisingly, Eyulan was furious that the vagrants had no gratitude towards Evernatten, as if it were natural that they should be allowed in. \u201cThe most critical problem right now is the food supply. At this rate, our stores won\u2019t last all winter. I say we kick the vagrants out immediately!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI object!\u201d Desir interjected almost immediately. \u201cMy lord, do you remember why you let the vagrants into Evernatten in the first place? You believe in being a lord for your subjects. Expelling the vagrants would be abandoning that conviction.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat conviction you speak of,\u201d replied Eyulan, \u201cdoes not simply refer to the vagrants, but also the actual residents of Evernatten. The same residents who are now starving because of these vagrants. Sacrificing the many for the few? Idiocy.\u201d Emotion and conviction spilled from her voice. \u201cThink about this. These vagrants are strangers, faces you\u2019ve never laid eyes on, and they are taking our goodwill for granted. How can we favor them? Should we not consider Wilhelm\u2019s own people first?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe can save both,\u201d Desir insisted. \u201cTo abandon one group needlessly is not what our lord believes in.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOh? We can? Our residents are afraid to leave their houses! We have no more rations, and no ability to obtain more! Face reality!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou\u2019re simply coming up with reasons to expel them! Why do you insist on acting as though expelling them is the only option? Why aren\u2019t you trying to come up with other options?!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOther options? Then present one! Can you? Can you come up with a solution to restore order to these vagrants hopping about like madmen and stop them from eating through all our rations?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d Wilhelm\u2019s voice instantly ended the argument. \u201cI believed, once, that we could save them all. But that was a foolish belief from a distant past. I was wrong.\u201d His voice was heavy and melancholic, and the words came out slowly. He turned toward Desir. \u201cI thank you for reminding me of those convictions I once so firmly held. But I cannot stubbornly refuse to change. Accepting all these vagrants will stretch what our territory can provide for beyond breaking.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Wilhelm sighed. \u201cIdeals and reality. It looks like the moment has come to return to reality.\u201d He paused, the chilling reality setting in like the winter\u2019s air, weighing on his heavy bones. The time for childish ideals was long past. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to save everyone. No, more than that, I lack the ability to care for everyone. I can no longer stubbornly refuse to accept this.\u201d He turned, slowly to Eyulan. \u201cApologize to the vagrants that we are no longer able to accept them.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d Eyulan was disturbingly giddy as she heard Wilhelm\u2019s words, assuring the expulsion of the vagrants.</p>",
    "<p>Ajest watched this exchange silently, unsure of how to proceed. Clearly, the completion condition for this shadow world was to change Wilhelm\u2019s decision to the correct one, but, as she watched the conversation unfold, she couldn\u2019t think of a single argument against Wilhelm\u2019s decision. She was certain, had she been in his shoes, that she would have made the exact same decision, which meant, unfortunately, that history was bound to repeat itself, leading to the quest\u2019s failure.</p>",
    "<p>As Ajest continued to think in silence, she saw Desir step forward and drop to his knees. Everyone froze, unsure of what to do.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cJust two days,\u201d pleaded Desir. He knew this would seem desperate, but it didn\u2019t matter to him anymore. If he had to abandon his pride for the vagrants that nobody else cared about, he would. \u201cGive me just two days. I\u2019ll come up with a plan.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest looked back and forth between Lord Wilhelm and Desir. Everyone waited with baited breath.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll grant you two final days.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>***</p>",
    "<p>The most urgent problem, it seemed to Desir, was resolving the food issue. The rations provided to Wilhelm\u2019s garrison had already been heavily reduced to accommodate for the influx of people. Naturally, the soldiers had complained, but Lord Wilhelm had quickly quieted them by eating the same meals as the soldiers, taking the lead on accepting the reduced rations. Days had stretched into weeks like this, but now the situation was becoming untenable. Desir had only two days to produce a solution, or the vagrants would be expelled, and the quest failed.</p>",
    "<p>To his credit, he had worked diligently on coming up with a solution to the vagrant problem, but so far, all his thinking had led him back to the same conclusion: there was no solution. Regardless of how he approached the problem, nothing he came up with would be better than simply expelling all the vagrants.</p>",
    "<p>For example: Desir had initially considered trying to \u201chelp the vagrants help themselves\u201d per se, by opening up apprenticeships and other opportunities for skilled individuals which would increase Evernatten\u2019s export activity, but, unfortunately, he quickly came to the conclusion that such a plan would take far too long to bear fruit. Training every skilled individual to the point where they brought in more money for Evernatten than they cost would take at least a month - time they didn\u2019t have.</p>",
    "<p>Desir sighed. \u2018No wonder the rewards for a 4th-level Shadow World were so good.\u2019 This Shadow World\u2019s rewards was the artifact \u2018Arms of Toa,\u2019 which increased an individual\u2019s mana pool. Due to his weak mana pool, Desir could only use first circle magic; without the artifact, he wasn\u2019t sure if he could reach even the Third Circle. If only the quest wasn\u2019t so incredibly difficult\u2026</p>",
    "<p>He shook his head, banishing those thoughts. \u2018I can\u2019t fail this.\u2019 If he failed, he would have to totally rearrange his plans. He looked up at the empty street ahead. The lack of merchants had brought sharp inflation to Evernatten, which meant that most stores were closed down due to a lack of customers. Compounding the emptiness, few residents walked about, afraid of the swarms of vagrants. The vibrant energy that once permeated the castle-city no longer seemed to exist. Desir felt all too aware of the frosty winds.</p>",
    "<p>As he trudged through the thick snow, deep in thought, he passed from the residential area into the propped up shantytown of the vagrants. The signs of activity returned to his senses, but it was a darker, bleaker activity, a far cry from vibrance or joy.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDon\u2019t stray from the line!\u201d The voices of soldiers barking commands from their station cut through the winter air. Desir saw a line of vagrants miles long, silently following the soldiers\u2019 orders with lifeless eyes.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOi! There won\u2019t be any food if you cut in line!\u201d The soldiers, seeing Desir approach, stopped and saluted.</p>",
    "<p>Desir waved them down. \u201cDon\u2019t mind me, you can keep working.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d The soldier went back to distributing rations. Desir peered down the impossibly long line of vagrants. They huddled in clumps for warmth, rubbing their hands to melt their frozen fingers as they waited restlessly. The lines had grown longer and the food supply smaller each time Desir came to observe them.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMister Desir!\u201d A voice shouted from behind. Desir turned to see Lilica standing next to Ajest and waving her hand excitedly. She had basically been evicted from the castle, and was now effectively amongst the vagrants.</p>",
    "<p>She held a fist-sized piece of rye in her hand; evidently, her ration. Desir came up to the pair of them. \u201cAren\u2019t you bored waiting?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNope,\u201d responded Lyrica, shaking her head forcefully. \u201cMiss Ajest stood with me so I wasn\u2019t bored at all!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest stood beside her in a full suit of plate armor. Nominally, she was here to keep an eye on the ration line, but truthfully, she was keeping an eye on Lyrica.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry things turned out this way, Lyrica.\u201d Desir said quietly.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNo, why are you sorry? You were very good to me. I think that it\u2019s thanks to you that I\u2019m able to get this much. Of course, it\u2019s too bad that Mister Pram couldn\u2019t be with you as well.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBut, I wish they told me why they chased me out. Mister Jefran just got really quiet and didn\u2019t say anything at all\u2026Did I do something wrong? Did they kick me out because I made a mistake?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir shook his head. \u201cLike I told you before, it wasn\u2019t anything you did.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat was it then?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir fell silent as well. How could he possibly explain the truth to her? It would be too cruel to expose the terrible reality to her. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to come back one day,\u201d he offered.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThen watch Carlos for me until then.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cCarlos?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the name of the snowman I made.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026Of course. Leave it to me.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Satisfied, Lilica disappeared into the mob of vagrants.</p>"
