    "<p>Freechel felt more at home as she worked through her first week\u2019s training schedule.</p>",
    "<p>The training was tough, but it was also very refreshing for Freechel as she finally felt that she was learning something new. It finally felt like she was now attending the great school known as the Hebrion Academy.</p>",
    "<p>Desir\u2019s party taught her so many things and it all became fuel to further drive her studies. For example, she successfully completed casting [Watering], the so-called hardest First-Circle water magic to cast.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018What\u2019s in store for me tomorrow? What will I learn?\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Freechel\u2019s confidence had increased. To the shock of other people that knew her, she now greeted everyone with delight. They asked her things like:</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIs this really Freechel?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026 ?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Freechel walked past a hallway and saw a crowd murmuring about something. Her feet naturally led her to the epicentre of the trouble.</p>",
    "<p>It was where the lockers were located. Once there she saw a familiar face. She pushed herself through the crowd and as soon as she saw the face of the person sitting in the center of the crowd, she couldn\u2019t help screaming.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cErje!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Erje was Freechel\u2019s former party member. She was a pleasant person that was always surrounded by friends. Of course, Freechel was one of her friends. Erje was staring at her locker with a pale face.</p>",
    "<p>Freechel was speechless when she saw the condition the locker was in. There was an unbearable scent wafting out from inside it. The intestines of some kind of animal were thrown into the locker and blood had splattered everywhere, even dripping down onto the floor.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOh, this\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Freechel was familiar with the scene in front of her. It was all too familiar to her.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cErje! Are you okay? Are you hurt?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cFreechel\u2026 ?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Erje turned her head and found Freechel in the crowd. Her eyes changed as if she had suddenly found herself face to face with a mortal enemy.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWh\u2026 What\u2019s wrong, Erje?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Erje wiped her tears with her sleeve before speaking.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a hypocrite. You\u2019re disgusting.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Freechel didn\u2019t expect to hear this. Freechel and Erje were not best friends, but they were still relatively close. Freechel found herself without any clues as to why the Erje standing in front of her was consumed by hatred. Freechel\u2019s face betrayed her bewilderment at this change of heart.</p>",
    "<p>Erje manically grinned.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t leave, this wouldn\u2019t have happened to me.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Her words tore Freechel\u2019s heart into pieces.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWho do you think I\u2019m doing all of this for?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>All of this.</p>",
    "<p>Hazing.</p>",
    "<p>This was something that Freechel had been on the receiving end of up until she left the party.</p>",
    "<p>After she moved to Desir\u2019s party, the bullying stopped.</p>",
    "<p>She thought it had stopped.</p>",
    "<p>No, it hadn\u2019t. The target of it had just changed.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all because of you. Because you ran away.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The new target of the bullying was Erje. The charm that she usually displayed had completely disappeared.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cGet the fuck away. I don\u2019t need your pity.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Erje turned around and started cleaning up her locker.</p>",
    "<p>Freechel\u2019s heart hurt so much. She was in this exact situation, getting bullied all the time up until recently, and nobody helped her. She was all alone. Freechel understood how Erje felt.</p>",
    "<p>She must be sad, miserable, and resentful.</p>",
    "<p>But that\u2019s all it was.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cErje, I think you're missing something.\u201d Erje stopped moving her hands.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me who you need to hate. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong to deserve your blame.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026 What? I became the new target all because you transferred to another party! What the heck are you talking about?\u201d Erje growled.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhy do you think it\u2019s because of me? You are bullied because there are bullies out there!</p>",
    "<p>Stop trying to avoid reality.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou became so ballsy, Freechel. Does your new party teach you how to lecture someone?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>*Click-clack*</p>",
    "<p>A girl in a school uniform walked down the hallway.</p>",
    "<p>Llada Iddel.</p>",
    "<p>She was a member of the party that used to give Freechel\u2019s previous party work and also happened to be the one that had bullied her.</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m saying what needs to be said. I should have spoken up about this issue before.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Freechel stated with pure determination.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cReally? So what difference does talking about it now make? Whatever you say, it will only tickle me.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Llada said as she shook her hand as if shooing away a fly.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI have no interest in you anymore. You better stay out of my way and watch from the sidelines. This has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat? You\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNow, I can see it so clearly. You are just a coward who only picks on the weak.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Freechel\u2019s impassioned words had clearly upset Llada.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cFreechel, you seem to have misunderstood something.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Llada started casting magic.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe fact that you are now in Desir\u2019s party doesn\u2019t mean that your blood has now changed.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>It was a violation of the rules to cast magic in the school building, but Llada didn\u2019t care.</p>",
    "<p>Second-Circle magic was hurled at Freechel.</p>",
    "<p>[Empage]</p>",
    "<p>Freechel cast defense magic, but she was only a First-Circle magician. Her magic couldn\u2019t block it.</p>",
    "<p>[Water Shield]</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOwww!!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>*Thud*</p>",
    "<p>It didn\u2019t do anything at all. Freechel\u2019s defense magic was torn as if it was a thin piece of paper.</p>",
    "<p>A wooden fist struck her abdomen and she flew back into the lockers.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cArrgghh\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Llada had clearly heard Freechel moaning in pain but she didn\u2019t care. She walked towards</p>",
    "<p>Freechel and stomped on her back. It didn\u2019t look like anyone would step up to stop her rampage. She walked back a few steps and then cast another Second-Circle spell.</p>",
    "<p>[Root Binding]</p>",
    "<p>*Crack*</p>",
    "<p>From the magic web, tree branches spread out and wrapped Freechel\u2019s body. The pressure it exerted was overwhelming.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNow, repeat after me. \u2018I as a worthless commoner, blamed a noble, and therefore deserve death.\u2019\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026 You are the worst.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWell, if you say so.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The tree branches started to tighten even further around Freechel\u2019s body. Her bones were at extreme risk of breaking into pieces, assuming she could withstand this pain for much longer.</p>",
    "<p>However, Freechel didn\u2019t let any sound of discomfort escape her lips.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>*Snap*</p>",
    "<p>Some unknown force instantly destroyed Llada\u2019s magic. The tree branches around Freechel disappeared.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cGet away from Freechel.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>It was Desir. He slowly walked toward the girls and gestured with his hand. Llada felt embarrassed, but she knew how strong Desir was. She stepped backward.</p>",
    "<p>Llada didn\u2019t notice Desir\u2019s casting. His magic and capability were so overwhelmingly strong that her ability was nothing great in front of Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDesir\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Freechel got up as she coughed. Desir noticed some bruises on her skin. He also saw some red marks here and there too.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI tried so hard not to yell at students.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir sighed as he continued walking.</p>",
    "<p>Llada felt the rage emanating from Desir and instinctively walked backward in an attempt to escape. But she found herself backed into a wall. There was no where else to go.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis is too much.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>[Slate]</p>",
    "<p>[Create Marsh]</p>",
    "<p>Llada felt her back start to get wet. It then felt as if the wall was about to swallow her whole.</p>",
    "<p>She stirred her body into action to get away from it, but as she moved her body sank into the wall faster.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWa\u2026 Wait! What are you doing?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>In the span of just a second, her body was half-buried in the wall. She could only twitch her fingers.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cGet me out!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t bury you if I had to take you out so soon.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Llada tried to cast magic to escape, but Desir simply swung his hand and blocked her magic.</p>",
    "<p>Llada was truly helpless.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ll be okay after this? If any professor comes by, you\u2019re dead meat.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWorry about yourself, kiddo. Your body is trapped in the wall under my Slate magic. I can rip your body into pieces very easily.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir started casting magic again.</p>",
    "<p>Llada sensed that she was in danger. She struggled in an attempt to free herself, however it was all in vain. After her struggles she found herself in the exact same place in the exact same wall.</p>",
    "<p>The magic was almost complete.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAnd this is magnifying magic. I usually use this to enlarge the size of an object, but today, I can use it to fill up the gaps and holes in the wall.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir\u2019s finger swung in a curved shape towards where Llada was buried in the wall.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cImagine if you were the hole in this wall. What would happen to you if I just closed up this hole?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>She\u2019d be suffocated.</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026 !\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI guarantee that it\u2019s pain on a whole other level to what you have experienced in your life so far.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>*Grin*</p>",
    "<p>Desir\u2019s smile gave everyone a chill.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cStop! This is enough! I understand what you\u2019re trying to teach me!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDid you stop torturing others when you were told to stop?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The magic cast started to glow.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAeeeeeiik!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Is he even going to stop?\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Tears poured out of Llada\u2019s eyes. She started sobbing uncontrollably. She was well past the point of caring about how shameful she would look. She then screamed.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSorry! I\u2019m so sorry! Please forgive me!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Her make-up blended with her tears and started to streak down her face. Her face became uglier as she cried and shouted. Desir didn\u2019t seem to care. He continued with his magic.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry! Please\u2026 Please forgive me!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The magic was invoked and left Desir\u2019s finger. Llada closed her eyes tight and screamed.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYaiiiikkkkkkk!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Llada bounced out from the wall as if it had barfed her out.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cScreeeek!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Llada didn\u2019t feel any pain. It was strange. She carefully opened her eyes, and she saw Desir standing in front of her looking down on her with a bleak face.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s how you say it.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir turned around and walked towards Freechel. He helped her to her feet.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring you to the medical center.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Freechel inquired with a look of curiosity plastered on her face.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI was walking by and sensed that someone cast magic. I just came by to check it out. I didn\u2019t expect this.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>If Freechel was only abused physically, then Desir wouldn\u2019t have realised until it was too late.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Freechel. I know you tried to solve this by yourself, but I couldn\u2019t help myself from jumping in.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Freechel was beat up mercilessly. Desir couldn\u2019t walk away from what he saw.</p>",
    "<p>Freechel smiled at Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNo, thank you very much Desir. Thank you for helping me.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir saw an unmistakable trace of agony concealed behind her smile. It was a bitter grin.</p>",
