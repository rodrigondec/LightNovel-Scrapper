    "<p>\u201c\u2026It\u2019s a bit cramped,\u201d mumbled Desir. Past the iron doors, the walkway was extremely narrow. Where they were standing, there was barely enough space for one person to squeeze through. More accurately speaking, the room itself was spacious, but they had little room available to them. The display shelves around the room were all blocked off by wire screens. \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped, security-wise,\u201d Desir said.</p>",
    "<p>Beyond the barbed wire, a wooden display stood in front of a keen-eyed merchant, who introduced himself as Ujukun. His eyes were very thin and slender, and accented by a few strands of greying hair. Wrinkles covered his bespectacled face, giving him the appearance of an old man. The merchant\u2019s hands rested on the counter, and his fingers rapped in anticipation of his new customers.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cJudging by the entrance, you seem quite concerned about security,\u201d remarked Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou can never be too careful,\u201d Ujukun responded. \u201cNaturally, plenty of thieves tend to come by.\u201d Ujukun pushed his glasses up and stopped tapping on the counter. A silence filled the air as Ujukun sized up the young man sitting in front of him. \u2018He\u2019s going to be a difficult one,\u2019 the merchant thought. His eyes lazily moved over to the other boy and he quickly recognized the face. \u201cWeren\u2019t you here about two days ago? Do you have something else to sell to me?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOn the contrary, he\u2019s here to see what he\u2019s sold,\u201d explained Desir. The merchant\u2019s expression turned sour, before Desir added \u201cOf course, this isn\u2019t for a refund. We will be purchasing it back.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>At those words, Ujukun\u2019s face lit back up and he was ready for business. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, you should have told me earlier.\u201d He entered the storeroom behind him. It felt like an eternity until the merchant returned with the sword.</p>",
    "<p>The silver paint on the sword flaked off, revealing years of rust underneath. Ujukun placed the sword on the counter.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a heavily rusted useless sword,\u201d explained Ujukun.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe price is 90 bronze pieces?\u201d asked Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf it were a sword, you would be correct. However, this is not a sword\u2014for a rapier, it is a bit large and light,\u201d said Ujukun with a delighted grin on his face. At this point, Desir recalled something\u2014the gift Romantica received from Doneta appeared in his mind.</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026Kemubin?\u201d guessed Desir.</p>",
    "<p>Ujukin calmly explained, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Not a sword, but a kind of Kemubin. In the empty space within this sword, a swordsman from a warrior\u2019s lineage would place something inside as a gift to their lover.\u201d As Ujukun confirmed Desir\u2019s assumptions, Pram began to shudder. He hadn\u2019t realized this when he\u2019d sold the sword. He broke out in a cold sweat as Ujukun continued.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe price will be 40 silver pieces,\u201d said the merchant confidently. This was the cost of living for a month for a Hebrion Academy student.</p>",
    "<p>Pram was unable to stay silent any longer. He yelled, \u201cYou never told me any of this when I sold it to you!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ujukun smiled at the boisterous youth, before responding. \u201cI never lied to you. You came to sell me a sword, so I appraised your sale as a sword. Of course, when you look at this rusted scrap of iron, it\u2019s completely worthless as a sword.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram clenched his fists and gritted his teeth. He was furious, and started spewing insults at the old man.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEnough,\u201d said Desir as he grabbed Pram by the shoulder and cut him off.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe price has gone up a lot since it was sold,\u201d said Desir.</p>",
    "<p>Ujukun furrowed his brow and responded with his own justification. \u201c40 silvers is cheap. If I knew how to open this Kemubin, I would have charged you 80 silvers.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Even high-grade Kemubin would rarely cost more 10 silvers, unless they were specifically laced in pure gold. No matter how they looked at it, there was no way this item should be worth 40 silvers.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018This sword is definitely the reason Pram wields a rapier.\u2019 Desir thought about it hard but quickly made a decision. If Pram once again picked up the rapier, 40 silvers was a price more than worth paying. \u201cI\u2019ll buy it.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMr. Desir!\u201d Pram was reluctant to have Desir pay the cost of his mistake. Desir ignored Pram\u2019s cry and took out his wallet. He counted out the silver pieces and pushed them towards Ujukun.</p>",
    "<p>The merchant gazed greedily at the coins in front of him. \u201c38, 39, 40. It\u2019s all there. Take it.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Simultaneously, the steel door opened and the Kemubin was laid in front of Desir\u2019s eyes. He raised the Kemubin and swung it around lightly. As expected, this is far lighter than you\u2019d think. Desir paused and gave it another thought. Is it possible that the Kemubin is empty? Why is the handle in such good quality but the rest of the sword worthless?</p>",
    "<p>The young man could\u2019ve wrap his head around the Kemubin. The sword Pram wields in the future had the exact same handle as this. Desir shifted his attention to the handle. He glanced at it from different angles, felt the contours and looked at it intently. The handle was extremely high quality. The rusted iron blade didn\u2019t match the intricate handle whatsoever.</p>",
    "<p>As Desir ran his hands down the spine of the blade, he continued searching for any sort of switch. As he felt around the edges of the handle, a smile appeared on his face. \u2018Found it.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>There was a small indentation on the sword handle\u2014it was carefully hidden by the design of the blade. Looking at it, it appeared to be a simple black line blended in with the wood grain. If Desir hadn\u2019t seen Doneta\u2019s Kemubin, he would have never been able to find it. Desir offered the Kemubin to his fellow student. \u201cTake hold of the sword, Pram.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram was speechless. \u201cWha\u2026But\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDo you see the indentation on the handle? Insert your fingernail and lower it like so,\u201d Desir insisted.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMr. Desir. I won\u2019t use this sword,\u201d replied Pram. Flashbacks of betrayal welled up from inside Pram. He couldn\u2019t\u2014no. He wouldn\u2019t let his father\u2019s legacy hurt him again.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cPram, this isn\u2019t the sword as you knew it. It was simply a Kemubin,\u201d said Desir, encouraging Pram to take a closer look.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEven so, it\u2019s useless. It\u2019s just an empty Kemubin,\u201d retorted Pram. Taking the Kemubin from Desir, Pram raised the sword up. He had this sword for years, and he knew. It was simply iron and nothing more. Pram looked at Desir apologetically. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that you spent 40 silvers for nothing, Mr. Desir.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf that Kemubin was empty, you would be correct. However, the situation is a little different from that,\u201d smirked Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis sword, Kemubin or not, has nothing else in it. It only weighs so much as the iron sword and the wooden handle.\u201d Pram frowned. Desir wasn\u2019t making any sense.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that you can\u2019t feel it. The item inside has no weight,\u201d explained Desir.</p>",
    "<p>Pram looked at Desir with doubt, as if he was going crazy. His expression was earnest, but his words sounded like a joke. \u201cThere is no such thing,\u201d answered Pram. He wasn\u2019t sure if he was answering Desir or trying to convince himself.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re having doubts, why not open it for yourself?\u201d questioned Desir. Pram bit his lip. A pregnant pause filled the air. Desir did his best to reassure him. \u201cListen to me, Pram. Trust me.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>After a moment\u2019s hesitation, Pram inserted his fingernail into the indentation. The sound of metal fixtures clicking into place rang in the storeroom. At the same time, the handle loosed itself from the previous iron blade. Now freed from its rusted prison, a sword emerged from the Kemubin, giving a luminescent glow.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBlanchume,\u201d muttered Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBlanchume?! That\u2019s impossible!\u201d exclaimed Ujukun.</p>",
    "<p>Blanchume was precious. Swordsmen from all over the world heard legends of the mystical metal and coveted its existence. Weapons and armor forged from this metal were unbreakable. In addition to that, Blanchume was nearly weightless. It was because of that Pram thought that the Kemubin was simply empty.</p>",
    "<p>Pram didn\u2019t dare take his eyes from the luminescent glow of the rapier. He never would\u2019ve thought that the tattered, rusted sword would metamorphose into a brillant sword that veterans with dozens of years\u2019 experience on him would covet. He didn\u2019t dare say a word at the fear of it all being a dream.</p>",
    "<p>In that Shadow Labyrinth, this is the exact sword that Pram used. At the same time Desir was satisfied with his decision, an eerie silence set off inside the shop. You could cut the atmosphere with a knife. \u201cOpen the door\u2014we\u2019re leaving,\u201d commanded Desir. Their business with Ujukun has finished.</p>",
    "<p>At that moment, the giant\u2019s sword crashed upon Desir\u2019s head. The cold steel was inches away from taking his life. \u201cThat\u2019s dirty of you,\u201d chuckled Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHand over that sword,\u201d demanded Ujukun.</p>",
    "<p>Desir wanted to laugh at the merchant\u2019s avarice. \u201cDon\u2019t make excuses now that we\u2019re done. What you sold was a Kemubin. I paid the price. Our transaction has finished,\u201d said Desir curtly.</p>",
    "<p>Ujukun\u2019s face grimaced at the thought of losing such a priceless item. \u201cIf I knew it was Blanchume, I never would have sold it,\u201d explained Ujukun.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf my friend knew it was a Kemubin, he never would have sold it either,\u201d retorted Desir. Based on the tone in Ujukun\u2019s voice, the time of pleasantries was over. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly as you did,\u201d continued Desir. He glared right at the merchant, who couldn\u2019t meet his eyes. Ujukun couldn\u2019t respond to that. He was outwitted by his own logic.</p>",
    "<p>As Desir took another step towards the door, the giant raised his glaive to Desir\u2019 neck. The giant opened his mouth for the first time. \u201cOwner\u2026said\u2026stop. You. Will stop.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026You\u2019re really going to push it this far?\u201d asked Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou should do this while I ask nicely,\u201d said Ujukun. All of his mercantile charisma drained out of him as he slowly unlocked a set of iron bars directly behind him. As he moved behind the bars separating him from the two youths, he set his gaze on the boy who sold him the Kemubin. Although he was capable of thinking rationally, Ujukun turned a blind eye to the events unfolding soon in lieu of his avarice. He would go to these lengths for an item made of Blanchume.</p>",
    "<p>Desir scratched his head. \u2018\u2026Well, I did reveal that it was made of Blanchume in front of him, but I didn\u2019t expect this to happen.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Ujukun\u2019s eyes turned cold as he made a motion of slitting his throat with his hand. The loyal barbarian did not hesitate. He took large strides towards Desir and it didn\u2019t take long before he enveloped his entire field of view. However, after 5 steps the giant had to stop. Pram stood stoically in his path.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight, but if you come any closer\u2026\u201d said Pram. He raised his rapier in perfect form, prepared to lunge at a moment\u2019s notice. His hips were low, and every muscle in his body was poised, ready to respond. Pram\u2019s small frame was in distinct contrast to his explosive aura. His lips were pursed, analyzing the giant\u2019s movements. \u201c\u2026Then not even I will forgive you.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>At the sound of the threat from the little boy, the giant roared in displeasure. The giant\u2019s muscles bulged as he swung his weapon. The glaive and rapier clashed head on. \u201cOraaaaa!\u201d screamed the giant. As he feinted a swing of the sword, he let loose a fist at Pram from the other side. He fought like a true swordsman of the North, blending together true swordsmanship and brawling.</p>",
    "<p>Pram found himself backed up against the wall. Without hesitation, Pram rolled to the side and evaded the attack.</p>",
    "<p>The wooden wall crumbled under the weight of the giant\u2019s fist. The barbarian spat in annoyance as he shook off the splinters embedded in his left arm. If Pram hadn\u2019t moved immediately, his head would have shattered like a watermelon. The behemoth let out a guttural cry. He unleashed a frenzy of strikes at Pram. The student, now equipped with his legendary rapier, was on his back foot in lieu of the reckless barrage.</p>",
    "<p>Swords clashed in the storeroom, one side with unbridled fury and the other with confident vigor. The hulking figure showed no signs of stopping his assault, and the rapier could only just parry the attacks. Pram dodged the glaive by the skin of his teeth. A split second of indecision was all it would take to signal his end. As the battle ensued, Pram began to dodge, roll, and parry all of the incoming attacks.</p>",
    "<p>The giant became tense. With the current pace, he would undoubtedly lose the duel. His attacks became more vicious and frightening. When Pram tried to side step the next attack, the enemy narrowed the distance with a single stride\u2014the distance was too short.</p>",
    "<p>The glaive swung down like a guillotine. A vertical strike with nowhere to go.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cKuarrrgh!\u201d The hulking figure roared in triumph.</p>",
    "<p>The ferocious blow landed on Pram\u2019s body.</p>"
