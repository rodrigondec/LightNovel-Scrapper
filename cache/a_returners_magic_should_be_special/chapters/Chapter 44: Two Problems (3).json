    "<p>Knowing that the castle wall was free of guards, the barbarians tossed grappling hooks and began to scale the walls of Evernatten Castle. Each barbarian was a hulking mass of flesh, and towered over the opposition. With inborn talents in close combat, each one was worth ten of any regular soldiers.</p>",
    "<p>The barbarians let out guttural war cries as the castle walls were overrun. After becoming complacent over the long periods of peace, the soldiers had become weak. Arrows drawn from their quivers arced through the snowfall, and one soldier after another breathed their last breath. The few who escaped the flurry of arrows were forced to hide behind the wall, only to become fodder for the barbarians, who split them in two with their hefty axes.</p>",
    "<p>Not a soul survived the massacre, and not a sound escaped the brutal slaughter.</p>",
    "<p>Bloody Talon scanned his surroundings, squinting as he hunted for his prey. In an instant, his eyes widened; he had found it. Through the slew of buildings and the white powder draping the landscape, the food stores were nothing but prey for the barbarian horde. \u2018There it is.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWarriors! We move!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The food stores were quite a ways off from their current location, but under the cover of snowfall, there was little problem. The troupe of barbarians descended the walls and plodded through the snow towards their objective. \u201cThere may be survivors. You. You\u2026\u201d Bloody Talon picked out ten warriors and had them keep watch.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAs you command!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The chosen scaled the walls once again, and the rest of the barbarians began their warpath. Their wrath would be swift.</p>",
    "<p>The soldiers who remained at the walls grumbled at Bloody Talon\u2019s commands. A barbarian ornamented with feathers was agitated at being left behind.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOur leader is too afraid. He fears that there are survivors among the guards? What kind of a warrior is he?\u201d The other warriors agreed with his complaints. They grew more audacious without Bloody Talon around.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe want to fight. This clumsy thievery is unbecoming of our tribe.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis is an embarrassment to our lineage.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI did not come here to slink around like a rat!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>At that moment, a gargantuan barbarian brandished his ax. His hair was like a lion\u2019s mane, and he dwarfed his fellow barbarians as he glared at the squabbling meatheads and chastised them. \u201cThe tribe leader\u2019s words are absolute. How much you like it doesn\u2019t matter; he is smarter than everyone else. You don\u2019t doubt him, do you?\u201d His words were tinged with an unspoken threat.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what we mean\u2014\u201c</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThen we follow his orders. Scatter. Keep a close watch over the walls.\u201d The barbarians reluctantly took a step back from the maned barbarian and carried out Bloody Talon\u2019s orders.</p>",
    "<p>The feathered barbarian traipsed along the pathways as he kept watch for any guards that may have survived. \u2018All the soldiers are dead. Bloody Talon doesn\u2019t miss.\u2019 There were a few soldiers lucky enough to hide, but they were finished off by the barbarians soon enough.</p>",
    "<p>As he continued walking, his thoughts drifted back to his complaints earlier. \u2018The tribe leader is a coward. He worries about nothing.\u2019 Just as he turned the corner, he heard a quiet shuffle. \u2018Probably just the breeze, but I won\u2019t hear the end of it. Sigh.\u2019 As he tried to look back, something wriggled from beneath the piled bodies, and he suddenly felt a deep pain in his chest. Looking down at his body, he found a sword piercing through his chest, bisecting his heart.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHow d\u2014\u201c</p>",
    "<p>The feathered barbarian couldn\u2019t finish his sentence before he passed. The one who stabbed him from behind, Pram Schneizer, pulled his sword from the corpse. The sword was drenched in scarlet, streaming down the length of the blade. \u201cAs Mr. Desir expected, there were enemies remaining.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>A few moments later, Desir emerged from the pile of bodies. \u201cNine to go.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf this is too difficult, we can head to guard post 14 to notify them. That place shouldn\u2019t have been attacked by barbarians.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Taking into account the distance between post 13 and post 14, Desir knew there was no way the guards would make it here in time. On top of that, the snowfall would make it immensely more difficult to communicate. \u201cIt\u2019s too far away.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>With precious seconds ticking away, Desir knew that he had to make a game plan. After careful consideration, he formulated a viable strategy. \u201cWe\u2019re going to break through and raise the bell at guard post 13. It should be possible between the two of us.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram nodded in response. \u201cI understand. Leave the vanguard to me.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>[Haste]</p>",
    "<p>The pair of students rushed towards guard post 13, and were quickly noticed by the barbarians on the wall. \u201cEnemies!\u201d cried the patrolling barbarians. Soon after, the rest of the barbarians left on the wall stormed to their location. The vanguards of the two parties clashed in furious intensity: the barbarian with his massive ax, and Pram with a broadsword.</p>",
    "<p>As the two of them fought blow for blow, Pram had met his match. His broadsword flew out of his hands in the first strike. He didn\u2019t have a ghost of a chance to match the strength of a barbarian in a duel.</p>",
    "<p>The barbarians laughed mockingly at Pram, as he ducked and weaved to dodge the incoming blows. The maned barbarian teased him as he tried to regain the initiative. The feathered barbarian lifted his ax above his head, swinging it down like a guillotine. \u2018I have him.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>It was at that moment, Pram dove towards the barbarian and gave him a nasty kick in his sides. Without much room to maneuver and already off balance due to his ax swing, the man hurtled off the side of the castle walls. His screams grew more distant, only to be cut off by a dull thud.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cPram!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cGot it!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram crouched to avoid the great balls of fire sent rushing towards him by the barbarian spellcasters. The barbarians spat on the ground, disappointed at the showing of their deceased clansman. The narrow walls left little room to dodge, and Pram was in trouble\u2014 if not for Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHacking complete. Pram, go!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram kicked off the ground, and the barbarians began to conjure their magic\u2014 but nothing happened. While the bewildered barbarians continued to try again and again, Pram closed the distance. Up until the last second, their magic refused to work. In frustration, the barbarians unsheathed their swords and attacked the blue haired boy.</p>",
    "<p>Regardless of the fact he was barehanded, Pram refused to back down. Small lights began to gather around his hands as he summoned his rapier in response to the unrelenting assault. The barbarians\u2019 eyes grew wide at the sight. Pram increased his speed one notch further, now equipped with his beloved rapier. A giant gash suddenly appeared on a barbarian. His face was filled with shock as he crumpled to the ground.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cQuickly now!\u201d Desir hurried Pram to the guard post, before stopping at the foot of the stairway. Past the stairway laid the guard post, but the remaining barbarians had grouped together and were advancing at a breakneck pace. \u2018They must have gathered while we were fighting.\u2019 Counting seven, Pram was on edge, ready to leap into combat.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it this time, Pram. Step back.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir\u2019s magic began to take form.</p>",
    "<p>[Melting Ice]</p>",
    "<p>1st Circle Utility magic. It was a magic that acted as advertised. Desir aimed the magic on the ground underneath the barbarians, and the piled snow melted into water.</p>",
    "<p>[Dry]</p>",
    "<p>Desir deployed a second magic as a follow up. The water surrounding Desir and Pram began to evaporate. Unlike the barbarians, their surroundings dried up. \u2018Dealing with seven people at once is a bit too much for a 1st Circle magician.\u2019 Having made the judgement call, Desir touched the corner of his Runegear, and the mana inside began to thrum with power.</p>",
    "<p>- Warning: Mana has been depleted to under 10%. Defensive capabilities will be compromised.</p>",
    "<p>Multiple alarms went off as Desir drew a significant amount of mana from the Runegear. \u2018The Runegear uses a 4th tier magic crystal. That should be enough for me to fight at full capacity.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThere he is!\u201d The barbarians had just reached the stairway and caught sight of Desir. The readied themselves for a fight, but the sight was ridiculous. The two of them were planning to fight the seven of them outmanned and outgunned. The barbarians descended the stairs to slaughter Desir and Pram.</p>",
    "<p>As they approached, water splashed in all directions. A reflection of Desir\u2019s face could be seen in the axe that was thrown in the air. Six of the barbarians were rushing down the stairs. They may have been outnumbered, but the barbarians were outwitted.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cClose your eyes.\u201d Desir said.</p>",
    "<p>His magic unfolded with a crash of thunder.</p>",
    "<p>[Summon Lightning]</p>",
    "<p>A paper thin beam stretched out, reaching to the heavens. The barbarians began to smile at the pitiful display of magic, and descended like a murder of crows. As a maned barbarian roared and slammed into the thin beam, his face dropped and his shrieks echoed across the castle walls. The dazzling flash was blinding, and for a split second the sky lit up as if it was still daytime. An intense current slammed into the barbarians and electrocuted them from the inside out. Their blood vessels popped and their skin was charred black, as if smited by divine retribution. The resulting scene brought a grimace to Pram\u2019s face. He felt queasy at the sight of the barbarians\u2014 what was left of them, anyways.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t\u2026 was that [Summon Lightning]?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>3rd Circle magic [Summon Lightning] called a powerful electrical current, but what Desir displayed was miles ahead of the [Summon Lightning] he was used to. Likewise, he expressed doubt if a 3rd Circle magician would even be able to take on seven barbarians with a single blow.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI modified the formula,\u201d explained Desir. He had broken the magic formula in order to overclock the spell. By reducing the range, he increased the strength of the current many times over. To make up for the limited range, he used the melted ice as a conductor and the result\u2026 was potent and gruesome.</p>",
    "<p>Taking a moment to check the mana levels of the Runegear, Desir sighed. With only one spell, he nearly emptied out the Runegear.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018I need to get Toa\u2019s Armaments now, and become a 3rd Circle magician.\u2019</p>"
