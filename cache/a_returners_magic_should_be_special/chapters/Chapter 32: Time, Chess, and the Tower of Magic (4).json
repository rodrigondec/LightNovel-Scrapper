    "<p>It was an incredible offer. With the 28 months to Desir\u2019s graduation, the total amount of money he would receive was\u2026</p>",
    "<p>\u201c3360 gold, by my calculations\u2014that should be sufficient to show that your efforts haven\u2019t been in vain. By winning a chess game, you have increased your reward 28 times over. With that, I wouldn\u2019t be going against my word, and you would more or less have a sponsorship.\u201d Zod stared firmly at Desir, awaiting his approval.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThose are very favorable terms. I almost want to accept immediately,\u201d said Desir, shaking his head. \u201cBut that won\u2019t change my request. I want to make a deal.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Zod expressed disdain at the boy\u2019s choice. \u201cI expected you to choose more wisely. You\u2019ve rejected my offer, and I can\u2019t accept your deal. With that, the negotiations are over.\u201d The man rose to get up from his seat.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNo, Tower Master. Let\u2019s clear this up first. It\u2019s not that you can\u2019t accept the deal\u2014it\u2019s that you can\u2019t accept the deal at a loss.\u201d At face value, this was evidently the case. \u201cHowever, this means you would accept the deal if it is equivalent exchange.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo you think this is a fair deal.\u201d The Tower Master was audibly upset by Desir\u2019s words.</p>",
    "<p>Desir saw the flaws. There\u2019s no way that anybody from the outside looking in would see this as fair. It was preposterous. He immediately went to appease his old colleague.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI understand completely where you\u2019re coming from, Mister Exarion. A mere student\u2019s idea versus the Tower of Magic\u2019s sponsorship. Logically speaking, there is no way that anybody would see this as fair.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir rose from his seat and toyed with the warship piece from the chess board. \u201cBut you of all people should know better than anybody else that there are plenty of things outside the realm of logic. For instance, a 20-year-old man becoming the Tower Master after developing the Enchant technique. Or maybe even less likely, a student of Hebrion Academy defeating the Tower Master in a game of chess.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat are you trying to say, then?\u201d Zod was not impressed, and waited for Desir to quickly get to the point.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cRegardless of how illogical it may seem, this deal is quite fair. If I must, I can prove it right now. Would you like to stay awhile and listen?\u201d Desir placed the warship directly in front of Zod as he waited for an answer.</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026Prove it.\u201d Zod crossed his arms, and gave him one chance to explain himself.</p>",
    "<p>Desir took in his surroundings. Bookshelves lined the walls of the entire room. The chess board they just played with lied on top of the desk, illuminated by a lamp as well as various magic crystals strewn about. He walked toward the desk and picked up one of the magic crystals. None of the crystals were enchanted, which left them unusable. Desir surrounded the magic crystal in a cocoon of his mana, and it began pulsating.</p>",
    "<p>A sound rang out from the crystal, like a musical chord. Desir began vibrating his mana particles one by one, and displayed his unique control over mana. \u2018Slowly, lock on to the frequency.\u2019 Second by second, Desir slowly raised the mana\u2019s frequency bit by bit until the whirring sound from the magic crystal began to vibrate more fiercely than before, and it reverberated back and forth.</p>",
    "<p>A look of shock appeared on Zod\u2019s face. \u2018He influenced the crystal\u2019s internal mana without using the Enchant method?\u2019 Based on his theory, this was impossible. If he didn\u2019t see if in front of his eyes, he wouldn\u2019t believe it himself.</p>",
    "<p>Desir paid him no heed. The internal mana continued whirling around violently, growing exponentially stronger. It spun vigorously, forming a perfect circle. As soon as Desir felt it reach its peak, he said two simple words. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The Tower Master\u2019s mouth was still agape. \u201cIt\u2019s over?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s all.\u201d Desir threw the magic crystal at Zod.</p>",
    "<p>Zod caught the magic crystal, still having difficulty wrapping his head around what just ensued. The magic crystal looked exactly the same, aside from the internal mana perpetually looping. Bewildered, he looked at Desir and asked, \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The answer he was looking for didn\u2019t come from Desir, but from the magic crystal.</p>",
    "<p>\u2014 \u201cSir? Is there an issue?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Zod nearly dropped the crystal upon hearing his secretary\u2019s voice.</p>",
    "<p>\u2014 \u201cMore importantly, there is less than one minute until your meeting.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The voice continued speaking.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt can also be used as a transmitter,\u201d explained Desir nonchalantly.</p>",
    "<p>Zod stood in a daze at the news. The 7th circle magician chose his next words very carefully. His voice trembled as he said, \u201cI\u2019ll call you back in a moment.\u201d Gently placing the magic crystal on the table, he turned back to Desir. \u201cI\u2019m going to need an explanation.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAs you can see, I placed a communication spell on the magic crystal. When you took her call earlier, I confirmed your secretary\u2019s number\u2014\u201c</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI can tell that much. I\u2019m asking how you placed the spell on the crystal without enchanting it.\u201d Zod\u2019s eyes were intent, searching for any clues he could find from this student who just blew his theory wide open.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEach and every mana particle has something called a unique frequency. If you can tune these frequencies with that of other mana particles, you can make them harmonize with each other, creating a mana resonance.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>And it was that unique phenomenon that hadn\u2019t been discovered yet in this age.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis mana resonance can be applied to a myriad of objects\u2014a magic crystal is no exception. If you vibrate its surroundings at the same frequency as the mana, the vibration allows it to travel out through the exterior mana shell, creating this kind of mana resonance.\u201d Desir took the crystal back from Zod, and once again displayed how it worked. \u201cIf you spin the surrounding mana, the stored mana spins with it. Once the rotations reach a critical point, the interior mana settles into a circular form. This form is often referred to as \u2018Circles\u2019, and with this\u2014\u201c</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou can activate as many spells as you want, even without the enchanting process.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Desir clenched the activated magic crystal in his hand. \u201cThe applications are endless. As long as the mana allows, you can activate dozens of spells at once. This means that we don\u2019t have to pointlessly deplete our magic crystals, and does away with the Enchant method\u2019s greatest flaw.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWith this technology, the Outers would have had no chance of breaking through your front gates. The Enchant method leaves you with the vulnerability of needing to choose between a physical and magical barrier, but this opens up a range of possibilities. Even if your circle is low, this method allows you to access the full breadth of magic as long as you have a magic crystal powerful enough.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>This was only the beginning. Using this method, countless techniques could be developed.</p>",
    "<p>Zod spoke, his voice shaking. \u201cDid you discover this?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI know of it.\u201d Desir didn\u2019t give a straight answer; in reality, Zod was the one who created this technique in the future, not him.</p>",
    "<p>3 years into the Shadow Labyrinth, Zod Exarion discovered mana resonance and it overturned his fundamental understanding of magic engineering. From there, he kept expanding on his theory, eventually allowing somebody to use a magic crystal without the Enchant method. This discovery led to humanity acquiring techniques to survive in the Shadow Labyrinth. Driven into a corner, humanity had no choice but to innovate and bring these discoveries to light.</p>",
    "<p>After returning to the past, Desir thought about bringing the techniques from the future to this age. If all of the knowledge gained from their desperate struggle could be brought back to the past, maybe it would increase the chances of clearing the Shadow Labyrinth. \u2018With the Tower of Magic\u2019s ability, they would be able to bring these techniques to life.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>That was it.</p>",
    "<p>Desir wasn\u2019t here to receive support; he was here supporting them. When the Tower Master compared the deal to exchanging a gold bar for a peanut, he was correct. However, he didn\u2019t realize where he stood.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis is extremely surprising\u2014it will rewrite the history of magic engineering as we know it.\u201d Zod\u2019s mind was hundreds of miles away, thinking about all of the possibilities that this could produce.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it, Tower Master. But I just want you to know\u2014this is only a small portion of the ideas that I have. I am willing to offer you every technique that I know of, and the Tower of Magic can use them in their products. All I ask in return is that you sponsor my party with items made using these techniques. This is my offer.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Zod\u2019s snapped back into focus as he heard Desir\u2019s words.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cA small portion\u2026\u201d Zod turned on his Pad without the slightest hesitation. \u201cSecretary, cancel the meeting.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u2014 \u201cSir? But\u2014\u201c</p>",
    "<p>The secretary was shocked.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNo\u2014not the meeting. Cancel everything until I say otherwise.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u2014 \u201cSir! What are you talking about? You have over twenty appointments to attend to!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cTell Hephatus to take care of it. I\u2019m going to hang up now. You likely won\u2019t be able to contact me for the next two or so hours.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Beep.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNow that the tiresome time limit is gone, we have the opportunity to discuss at length.\u201d Zod looked lively and ravenous for more information.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI take it that you\u2019re accepting the deal?\u201d asked Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI should hope so, lest I\u2019ve gone mad.\u201d The Tower Master laughed mockingly at himself and held his outstretched hand to Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis way, Mr. Desir!\u201d Pram called out to the party leader and waved enthusiastically.</p>",
    "<p>Desir joined them at the table and looked around. This was a rare sight even in the capital. \u201cSo you managed to find a place like this. An ice cream store, huh.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHmph. Country bumpkin.\u201d said Romantica with a haughty expression. \u201cBaskin-Rise 79 is a must-see if you ever visit Altaea! You can\u2019t leave the city without trying Very Berry Strawberry and Cotton Candy! They\u2019re to die for!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir had a little chuckle at Romantica\u2019s words. \u201cSo you\u2019re telling me to order those, right?\u201d He waved down the waiter and made his order as Pram asked him about his meeting.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDid it go well, Mr. Desir?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOf course, It\u2019s all sorted out.\u201d Desir chuckled and thought to himself how cute Pram was.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cPhew. That\u2019s a relief.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cA relief to be sure, but\u2026\u201d Romantica took a big breath. \u201cCould you explain?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat do you want me to explain?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe reason you refused the 120 gold reward. In all honesty, I can\u2019t possibly imagine why you gave up 120 gold to play chess.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAh, that. The main objective wasn\u2019t to play chess with the Tower Master, but an excuse to meet him. My real objective was to ask for support, and as I said before, everything is sorted out. For now, we have support on the level of a sponsorship.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWow!\u201d Pram jumped up in the air in celebration. To think that the lofty Tower Master had given them his support!</p>",
    "<p>Romantica looked at Desir, suspicious. There was no way that he did this legitimately. \u201cDid you figure out his weakness or something? Is he corrupt, or experimenting with living creatures? Knowing you, you must have blackmailed him\u2026\u201d She shivered, thinking of what the Tower Master might have gone through.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cJust what kind of person do you think I am!?\u201d exclaimed Desir.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica grimaced at Desir. \u201cA complete sadist. I\u2019m definitely not the only one who thinks so. Pram, tell him.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMister Desir, you sh-shouldn\u2019t bl-blackmail people. It\u2019s not good\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEt tu, Pram?\u201d Desir fell to his knees.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHeheh. It\u2019s a joke, Mister Desir. I believe in you.\u201d Pram stuck his tongue out, smiling playfully. He looked so cute that the other two couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p>"
