    "<p>It was wintertime. The snow was knee deep and the winds were bitter cold.</p>",
    "<p>Soldiers gathered in the cafeteria to receive their ready made meals. Everyone deployed to the castle gathered here to eat. The cafeteria was bustling with conversation. People were talking so loud that it was easy to eavesdrop and discern information about various parts of the castle. Desir and his friends were gathered in a corner of this raucous cafeteria.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo it turns out, after all, that Miss Romantica isn\u2019t in this territory,\u201d said Pram. He, Ajest, and Desir had taken up an entire table in order to have a private conversation.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cShe can handle herself,\u201d said Desir, adding some salt to his soup.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you concerned at all about Miss Romantica?\u201d asked Pram.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI am a bit worried, but I have faith in her abilities,\u201d replied Desir. Romantica was now a Third Circle Mage, putting her on a completely different level than an average Second Circle Mage. Third Circle Mages were considered the cornerstone of any military. She would be strong enough to handle most situations at her current level of strength.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAnyways, I\u2019ve felt this during the entrance exam, but Romantica is clever. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s progressing the quest in her own way,\u201d continued Desir. The quest was still progressing within the Evernatten territory even though Romantica was nowhere to be found. \u201cBut just in case, I\u2019ve asked the Lord to dispatch a rider to nearby territories. The Shadow World wouldn\u2019t just put her somewhere random, so she\u2019s probably somewhere nearby.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir was confident that this would be enough to locate Romantica.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat is a bit more reassuring,\u201d replied Pram.</p>",
    "<p>Breakfast time was slowly drawing to a close. As the soldiers stood up and filed out one by one, the atmosphere in the cafeteria began to settle down.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo, why did you ask us to meet?\u201d asked Ajest, putting down her empty plate.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cActually, I discovered how the vagrant situation was resolved historically.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The remaining part of the main quest, Vagrants. Pram\u2019s ears perked and Ajest linked her arm with Desir\u2019s, listening intently as Desir began to recount what happened the day before. Yesterday, when he was busy working in the Lord\u2019s office, Eyulan came in and recommended deporting vagrants. Once the Lord agreed to the expulsion, the quest progression dipped even though the lord decided to only expel the criminals. Historically, this was also how the Lord had decided to resolve the vagrant situation as a whole.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cLook at this Ajest,\u201d said Desir, finishing his story and pulling out a handkerchief from his pocket. He held it out to Ajest. The material was poor, but the embroidery was beautiful.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite an intricate work.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOne of the vagrant mothers made it for me, but they can\u2019t even sell it. They are banned from the marketplace simply because they are vagrants,\u201d said Desir, shaking his head, \u201cAjest, does this remind you of anything? The way they look at a part and judge the whole?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest and Pram tilted their heads quizzically. They pondered the question for a while but could not come up with an answer. It was impossible for Ajest, as only those who experienced the descrimination would understand. Thus, it was Pram that raised his hand. Desir pointed at him.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBeta Class?\u201d said Pram confidently.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d confirmed Desir. Pram and Desir, being from the Beta class, could distinctly recall all the prejudice and discrimination that they faced first first hand. They were derogatorily known as \u2018commoners\u2019 and were not given the opportunity to receive proper education.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThere are people,\u201d continued Desir, \u201cwho have already decided that the entire population of vagrants are criminals just because they are \u2018vagrants.\u2019 Doesn\u2019t that remind you of Professor Nifleka, who had already decided that all commoners were incompetent simply because of their origin?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d Ajest swallowed her words. Having observed Professor Nifleka up close longer than anyone, she knew this was true.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf there are criminals within the vagrants, it is only just that they are punished. However, I can\u2019t accept how the entire population is being judged based on the actions of a few. Could it not also be said that society is at fault for driving them into a corner and not giving them a chance?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest looked as though she had been punched in the gut.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDoes this have anything to do with the clear condition?\u201d interjected Pram.</p>",
    "<p>Desir nodded.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s correct that the vagrant problem can be resolved by removing the vagrants that are causing it. However, the Shadow World has deemed the Lord\u2019s decision to be the \u2018wrong choice.\u2019 I believe this is because that decision is based on that prejudiced mindset.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir did not know what impact Wilhelm Evernatten\u2019s choice had in history or why the Shadow World had deemed this choice to be the wrong one. He could only make assumptions from what he had learned thus far.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThankfully, the situation right now isn\u2019t terrible since we saved the food supplies. Evernatten can hold on for the time being. Since the issue with the barbarians have been resolved, there is nothing immediately threatening the territory. Let\u2019s take time to think of a solution carefully.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>In history, the Lord had been driven into a situation where there was no other recourse, but things were different now. There was still time to find the best solution.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cKnight Captain!\u201d It was the voice of a knight. Ajest turned around to see a knight moving in her direction. \u201cAh, the tactician is here as well. That\u2019s good. I urge the two of you to follow me.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026I think you should see it for yourself.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir, Pram, and Ajest were breathing heavily as they looked out from the top of the castle walls. The cold air burned in their tired lungs, but their heart raced more when they saw the bright red flag in the distance.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>A sea of people filled their vision. An incredible amount of people were swarming at the castle gates: hungry people, people wearing rags, sick people making pitiful noises. They were all looking towards the castle with desperate faces. They were all vagrants.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cLet us in!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMy baby is dying! Let me in! Just the baby at least!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Voices of the vagrants drowned out each other in a crowd that easily exceeded three thousand. Desir and Pram turned pale, unable to believe the awful scene before them. This was a terrible turn of events. A sound of displeasure escaped Ajest\u2019s lips. It wasn\u2019t just Desir\u2019s party who were shocked, nearby soldiers were also taken aback. The castle gate below was sealed shut and was the only thing holding back the swarming vagrants.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cJust where did so many vagrants come from?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cJust what is this situation\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Normally, the soldiers would have accepted the vagrants following the Lord\u2019s policy. However, the number currently gathered at the gate was simply too much. The soldiers panicked and shut the gate to seal off the entrance. It was actually the best course of action given the situation. If the swarm had been allowed to enter, the resulting situation would be even worse. Still, Desir found himself speechless when faced with such a spectacle out of the blue.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis much\u2026is dangerous.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Accepting all these people will empty out the food supplies. The sea of vagrants pounded at the gates in waves. The quest seemed to be daring Desir to accept the vagrants.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you letting us in!?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou said you\u2019d accept vagrants!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhy are you discriminating against us!?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOpen the gates right now!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The demands were growing hostile and profanities could be heard mixed in every now and then. The voices stabbed at Desir\u2019s heart like needles. Lord Evernatten\u2019s generosity had already become an entitlement in their minds and they were enraged that they were refused entry.</p>",
    "<p>As Desir\u2019s party stared out with agitated faces, a messenger sent by the Lord knelt down beside them.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat does the Lord say?\u201d asked Desir to the kneeling man.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHe says accept them all for now.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOf course he would.\u201d Desir had already expected this decision.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAre you really going to let them in Desir?\u201d asked Ajest incredulously, \u201cwhat little public order we managed to obtain will be shattered instantly. No, even if I somehow manage to restore it to some extent, what about the food supply? Accepting these people will put the survival of this territory into question.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The survival of Evernatten. That was the name of the main quest and also the main portion of the assignment given to them. Desir could only out at the crowd of vagrants that were also his assignment.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYour orders.\u201d The soldiers looked at Desir, waiting for instructions. Presently, he was the one with the most authority. Pram and Ajest could only helplessly watch his mouth. Desir\u2019s lips clenched for what felt like an eternity before opening to speak.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOpen the gates.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>As soon as Desir\u2019s spoke, the soldiers raised their voices to relay the order.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHe says open the gates!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOpen the gates!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The orders quickly spread down to the other soldiers. Desir turned to Ajest.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAjest, please try to contain them for now.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026Leave it to me.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest climbed down from the castle walls and ordered the soldiers to create a path for the vagrants to enter. Desir could only watch with clenched fists.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018I talked arrogantly about how we should give them all a chance and yet I hesitated when it came time to accept more of them.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>He had hesitated. He had truly hesitated on his decision to accept these people. He already knew how overwhelming the situation was before and immediately thought that he could not accept any more vagrants.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018\u2026Damn.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Desir\u2019s hesitation made him feel pathetic. He tasted blood from where he had bit down on his lip.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSir Desir,\u201d said Pram, approaching him with a faint smile.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Pram.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I will always follow Sir Desir\u2019s decision.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI appreciate it.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The sound of chains moving filled the air as the gates finally opened. The vagrants began to pour in like the tide. Thanks to Ajest\u2019s direction, they were funnelled through into the territory in an orderly fashion. Once the final person entered, a system notification appeared.</p>",
    "<p>[Progress of the \u2018Vagrants\u2019 quest has declined by 15%\u2026]</p>"
