    "<p>Kelt Pasil Niplica was one of the top students within the academy who had earned great titles like being the Grade 2 leader of the Blue Moon party and also being a single ranker at the Fourth-Cirlce. He was also the younger brother of Professor Pugman. Every single person in Hebrion Academy knew who he was.</p>",
    "<p>And Desir beat Kelt. In front of all of the Grade 1 and 2 single rankers. Desir knocked him off the stage clearly and fairly. This of course brought a significant change to Desir\u2019s school life.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDid you see how he walked away? It was bizarre.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica said.</p>",
    "<p>They were sitting in Desir\u2019s party office. Romantica\u2019s laughter was loudly amplified in the small room. Just like Romantica had said, after the big battle, they had confronted Donetta a few more times during lectures. He had completely lost his morale. He was too dispirited to spend energy blaming and finger pointing at Desir. Rather he was busy rushing out of his way to avoid Desir whenever he encountered him.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou look happy, Romantica.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir voiced and Romantica nodded in response to.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOf course! You knocked them down a few pegs so easily!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>This unfortunately hadn\u2019t changed how people looked at Desir\u2019s party. It had however slightly reduced the bawling of the nobles that had been blatantly expressing their unpleasant thoughts and emotions up until now. There were now far fewer people questioning Desir\u2019s ability to fight.</p>",
    "<p>Desir\u2019s party members no longer needed to blush in anger and bottle up their anger at these people. It was a very peaceful and comfortable school life that they had not been able to experience previously.</p>",
    "<p>Finally, there were more.</p>",
    "<p>*Knock knock*</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAnother one?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica got up from the couch and adjusted her sleeves. She dragged over a chair and set it up in front of Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring the tea.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram chirped as he went into the kitchen.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>After Desir\u2019s greeting, the door opened. A girl with short brown hair and huge dark-framed glasses walked into the room.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHow can we help you?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica kindly but impatiently asked the girl.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cProfessor Vanquik told me that your party helps people train with no requirements to join\u2026 I would like to join the party.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Professor Vanquik.</p>",
    "<p>He taught Rune class and had supported Desir since the second semester started. He was a commoner like Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWell, please take a seat first.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>When Desir sat down in front of the girl, Pram brought over some snacks. From the pile of papers, Desir pullFreechel hesitated.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWell, your party is so powerful, and I\u2019m only a Beta student\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThere are no limitations or restrictions for application. You don\u2019t have to worry about it, but</p>",
    "<p>Freechel, have you heard about our party?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes, I have. The training is really hard, and all of the nobles hate this party.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThen, why do you want to join our party?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Of course, there were parties that existed among the Beta classes. However, their primary mission was a lot different from the clearing of the Shadow Worlds. For some of the lucky students, they could participate in Class Seven Shadow Worlds to receive some advantages from the Alpha Class party. Unfortunately, some Beta class parties were only established to serve the Alpha class. It was an ugly result of unfairness and injustice.</p>",
    "<p>Desir used his communication pad to retrieve information about Freechel. Her old party was called Arach, one of the subcontracted parties that assisted Alpha class by looking up information related to the Shadow World battles.</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026 I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Freechel pulled out her communication pad from her inner pocket and showed Desir some pictures from it. There were many pictures. The pictures of textbooks torn apart, desks with broken legs\u2026</p>",
    "<p>Desir frowned his face. Now he fully understood why Freechel had come to him.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDid you get bullied?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Freechel nodded and continued.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBut no one in my party could help me. Even the professor. He couldn\u2019t oppose the Alpha class by helping me out.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>In Hebrion Academy, all of the bullying and hazing by the nobles was ignored and overlooked without exception.</p>",
    "<p>Even though all of the party members of Arach seemed like they had ignored the violence and cruelty, Freechel didn\u2019t seem to be bothered. It wasn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t want to help, but it was more of a case that they couldn\u2019t help.</p>",
    "<p>Desir pressed on his left eye with his fingers. It was not easy to help other people as doing so increases one\u2019s own exposure to dangerous situations. The people who needed to be blamed and punished were the people who bullied her.</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026 if it\u2019s only because of this, you don\u2019t have to join our party. We can solve this problem for you.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Freechel shook her head.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s meaningful in that way. Sure, I want to pay them back. Doing so would make me feel better. That\u2019s why I came here. You train your members with no requirements.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOk. We will train you to the best of our ability.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>So Freechel was accepted as a member of the party.</p>",
    "<p>Desir looked at the list of the party members. There were three new members, including Freechel, on the list. Ever since Desir won the sparring fight with Kelt, people had come to Desir\u2019s party to join.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018The Beta class students who were bullied by nobles, and couldn\u2019t do anything about it, have started coming to our party.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>It was a good sign. Everything that Desir had deliberately shown to people had now started to show its effect.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018It\u2019s really disappointing how Beta Class training is designed.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>There were no big changes to the Beta classes.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018And there will be some talented people who will fall into Beta classes next year as well.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>These students couldn\u2019t take decent classes, simply because they were commoners. Amongst them there would be talented students that had a decent amount of potential but without professional training, would never realise it. They needed to be trained, not tamed by the Alpha Class.</p>",
    "<p>The cause of all of this was a deeply rooted prejudice against commoners by the nobles.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018It all came from the revolution that the Revolutionaries caused.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>This even happened twelve years ago, leaving an unavoidable scar on both the commoners and nobles, with lasting effects to this very day. The situation just wouldn\u2019t change unless the hatred from both sides disappeared.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018We need to change this.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Nobles and commoners needed to reconcile, so that commoners could be recognized.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Gather all of the talented students. Then, provide them with an environment where they can get decent training and flourish.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>There were so many students from Beta Classes that would ace things with proper training.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Like capturing a Shadow Labyrinth.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>* * *</p>",
    "<p>Adjest was standing in the middle of the training facility. The dawn fog had not even disappeared yet.</p>",
    "<p>She swung her sword nonstop as her shiny silver hair danced in the air. She brought out her mana to the fullest extent and didn\u2019t stop practicing until reaching her limit. It was a practice to handle the sword more delicately and she had been repeating this since the second semester started.</p>",
    "<p>Adjest bit her lip incredibly hard.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018I couldn\u2019t do a single thing.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Adjest recalled how helpless she was in the Prillecha Empire.</p>",
    "<p>Until she had encountered the Crow Mask, she thought that she was on the same level as Desir. However, it was purely her own delusion of grandeur.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cCan you stop Pram and Romantica from leaving the ship?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir asked Adjest while they were running away from Dadenewt.</p>",
    "<p>Then, Desir sacrificed himself. Adjest couldn\u2019t take it. She couldn\u2019t take herself watching helplessly from the sidelines. She couldn\u2019t do anything at all.</p>",
    "<p>*Crack*</p>",
    "<p>She momentarily lost her attention. The ice attached to her sword fell off. Adjest decided to stop practicing and sat down for a short rest.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Adjest\u2019s ability was unimaginably great in comparison to others, but the wall of the Fourth-Circle Bishop class was not so easy to break through as a magic-swordsman.</p>",
    "<p>*Pitapat*</p>",
    "<p>Adjest felt someone approaching her and immediately turned to look in that direction.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou\u2019re early today, Adjest.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica was walking towards her. She was wearing light training clothes. She clapped, and the dawn fog disappeared.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDo you have any business with me?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica stopped in front of Adjest.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m at the training facility. What do you think I\u2019m here for? I\u2019m here to train, too.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Then Romantica cast a spell at Adjest without warning. It was a Second-Circle spell.</p>",
    "<p>Adjest lifted her sword and blocked it.</p>",
    "<p>*Thud*</p>",
    "<p>A grand sound echoed across the training facility.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat the heck was that?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cA practical training session!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>A practical training session.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou want to be stronger, don\u2019t you? I want to be stronger. And we can finally end the duel we started at the Yellow Ocean Competition.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The Yellow Ocean Competition.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica and Adjest had a chance to compete with each other, but they were interrupted by the Outsider\u2019s terrorist attack and lost that opportunity.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI want to settle it. How about you?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Adjest assumed that Romantica wasn\u2019t simply saying it to figure out what the result of that competition would have been. Romantica had always kept Adjest in check. She had always been like that.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018But this is not a bad opportunity.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Adjest decided that it wasn\u2019t a bad time to practice her magic sword, like in a real battle.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica had been trained by Desir for more than a half year. She was a great magician.</p>",
    "<p>Adjest had no reason to decline. She lifted her sword as her answer.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s no fun if we ONLY practice with nothing on the line.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Adjest responded with.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe person who loses will clean up the office until we have another competition, and the result is flipped. If you accept this condition, then I\u2019ll practice with you.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>She suggested.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica was speechless.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Cleaning\u2026? That\u2019s nonsense!\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Romantica grew up as a noble girl. She wasn\u2019t used to doing menial chores like cleaning. And it was a big problem that there was no specified duration to this ridiculous outcome. It was possible that she might end up cleaning the office forever.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018I should win. If I win, I can watch Adjest clean up the office all the time.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Romantica hesitated for a bit, but soon she nodded her head.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll take that bet. Don\u2019t complain later.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI like that.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Adjest smiled.</p>",
    "<p>She raised her magic power, and calmly planned her strategy. She had a feeling that for the first time in a long while, she would finally be able to fight at her peak strength.</p>",
