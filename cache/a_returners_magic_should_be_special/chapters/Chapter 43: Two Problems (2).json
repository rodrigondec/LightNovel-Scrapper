    "<p>Soon after, Desir returned with some warm tea and dried fruit. He wrapped up his story and urged Pram to tell his own in return. As they ate, Pram explained how the Shadow World had gone for him: initially, he had been quite hesitant. He had been left all alone, but worked diligently on his assigned quest. Despite his many mistakes and the complications they created, he ultimately completed his first quest. \u201cI\u2019m now on a quest to perform a meritorious deed in the annual battle against the barbarians, and to receive an ordination of knighthood,\u201d he concluded.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBarbarians?\u201d Desir asked in response.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes. There\u2019s nothing to eat in the frozen tundra of the north. As a result, they raid this region\u2019s fertile territory every year,\u201d explained Pram.</p>",
    "<p>As he finished his explanation, a notification appeared in front of Desir.</p>",
    "<p>[You have learned about the \u2018Barbarians\u2019 problem, one of the two problems facing the Evernation Territory.]</p>",
    "<p>\u2018So the barbarians problem was the other one.\u2019 Desir surmised wordlessly. He bit into one of the dried fruits he had brought along. \u201cHow\u2019s your progress on the quest?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWell\u2026 about that\u2026\u201d Pram sighed. \u201cI\u2019m in the same situation you\u2019re in, Mr. Desir. I haven\u2019t even seen a single barbarian.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAccording to the scouting parties, nobody has seen any signs of a barbarian raid. The Order of the Knights has already declared that the barbarians have given up on raiding this year.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe barbarians have given up?\u201d Laughter mixed with incredulity seeped into Desir\u2019s voice. \u201cThat cannot possibly be true.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a baseless claim, Mr. Desir. Ever since Wilhelm became the lord, the barbarians haven\u2019t been able to break through the wall even once. They\u2019ve failed for five straight years; don\u2019t you think it\u2019s about time they gave up?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDo you remember the barbarian you met before?\u201d asked Desir suddenly.</p>",
    "<p>Pram nodded. He remembered the barbarian he met at the Uzuken Marketplace.</p>",
    "<p>Desir continued his questions. \u201cAnd what kind of feeling did you get from him?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026like they were the physical embodiment of the spirit of war,\u201d Pram reluctantly conceded.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo what do you think they\u2019ll be like when they gather into a group? Normal logic doesn\u2019t work on these barbarians. An impregnable fortress? The very idea will only embolden them to try harder.\u201d Desir\u2019s voice had an authoritative edge to it, as if he knew a great deal about the barbarians. He did, in truth: he had fought with the King of the Barbarians for 10 years inside the Shadow Labyrinth. He had learned a great deal about them by simply watching Donaif lead his people into battle. \u201cOn top of that,\u201d Desir continued, \u201cThey\u2019re starving, and the fertile land is sitting in front of their eyes. Give that up? No. They\u2019ll give everything to break through.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir lowered his voice an octave. \u201cIt might even be the case that they haven\u2019t shown their true strength yet, to make Evernatten underestimate them.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make sense, Mr. Desir. Why would they try what they think is an underhanded trick, when they\u2019re so hawkish and love testing their strength?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir nodded at Pram\u2019s objection, in partial agreement. \u201cYou\u2019re correct Pram, but they\u2019re already behaving quite irregularly because they haven\u2019t revealed themselves yet. That means we have to consider another important factor, outside of the unique traits of the barbarians.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe existence of an Opponent. Almost all Narrative Shadow World instances deal with a historical incident involving two opposing forces. In that case, there must be another key character who acts as the antagonist to Lord Evernation. He must be the one leading the barbarians, and the one who set up this new strategy.\u201d Desir fell into deep thought, and continued, half mumbling, \u201ctheir objective is food\u2026they haven\u2019t revealed themselves yet however\u2026that\u2019s right. If they\u2019re trying to plunder some food, they don\u2019t need a large number of troops.\u201d Therefore, Desir emphatically concluded, \u201cThey plan on ambushing the guards of the food storage warehouse and raiding it with a small strike force.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>This could be described as the \u201csecret problem\u201d facing Evernatten. Understanding it hinged on a deep understanding of the barbarians.</p>",
    "<p>A message appeared in front of Desir as soon as he finished his voicing his thought.</p>",
    "<p>[Your surprisingly high insight has discerned the plans of the barbarians from a very small hint.] [The hidden quest \u2018Raid\u2019 has begun.]</p>",
    "<p>[The barbarians will infiltrate the castle in 3 days. Their goal is the rations within the food storage warehouse. Stop the raid!]</p>",
    "<p>[The soldiers\u2019 morale will plummet if they run out of food.]</p>",
    "<p>[People living in Evernation and the surrounding territories will starve in a cold winter.]</p>",
    "<p>[Tension between people living here and the barbarians will increase.]</p>",
    "<p>[There are currently 4 months worth of food stored.]</p>",
    "<p>------------------------------------------</p>",
    "<p>The fire from the brazier crackled noisily, casting long, pale shadows over the stones as Desir and Pram climbed up the castle walls to survey the region. As they walked along the wall, they made a simple sketch of the key features of the area, and estimated the locations of the guard posts.</p>",
    "<p>Desir had taken a quarter of a day to look over the entire region, and picked out the three most likely locations from which the barbarians would attempt to infiltrate the castle. First was the space behind the watermill, where the wall was relatively low, due to the hill beyond the wall. Next, the southern wall, where the distance between the guard posts was relatively long, leaving the region sparsely manned in comparison. Third, the west gate, the closest gate to where the food storage warehouse was located.</p>",
    "<p>As the territory of Evernation was relatively wide, it was, unsurprisingly, difficult to keep up adequate patrols; opportunity for the barbarians most definitely existed. Desir turned to Pram. \u201cHow did asking your fellow soldiers to increase the density of their patrols go?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram sighed. \u201cNo good. Nobody believes me, no matter how much I try.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHow\u2019s your relationship with the other soldiers?\u201d Desir asked.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d responded Pram. \u201cI haven\u2019t been mindful of their affection level, so I don\u2019t really know.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThey\u2019re probably skeptical because their affection level for you isn\u2019t high enough.\u201d Desir explained. They continued their walk, and Desir continued his explanation. \u201cYou said the Knight\u2019s Order already claimed that the barbarians wouldn\u2019t invade right? You would probably need an affection level of \u2018Trusting\u2019 at the minimum for them to believe you over the Knight\u2019s Order.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram sighed again. \u201cTo think that affection level had that kind of effect\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late do anything about it now. We\u2019ll have to come up with a plan on our own.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>In the intervening time, Desir and Pram had cut their own sleeping hours short in order to patrol the tops of the castle walls. Immediately after their regular work ended, they would climb the walls to patrol the areas that Desir determined were the most likely staging points for the attack.</p>",
    "<p>They had discovered, unfortunately, that the situation was even worse than they initially thought. The soldiers guarding the walls were completely unprepared for an ambush. They lacked any discipline, and spent most of their time dozing off or chatting with one another.</p>",
    "<p>Desir sighed. \u201cWithout any tangible enemies, they feel no urgency.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard enough doing this work with three people\u2026if even the soldiers are like this\u2026\u201d Pram\u2019s voice was uneasy.</p>",
    "<p>It soon became the job of Desir\u2019s patrol group to wake the soldiers during their own patrols.</p>",
    "<p>On the second day of their patrols, it began to snow. It was the first time it had snowed since Desir had arrived, and it was heavy. By the time their patrol of the first area, the watermill, had concluded, the snow had piled up several inches. Their steps left deep imprints as they moved forward.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOur visibility has been reduced quite substantially, thanks to this snow. We\u2019ll have to be extra careful today.\u201d Desir shouted over the din of the winter storm. He gripped tightly to his clothes as they billowed in the wind. \u201cPram, you\u2019re still wearing your Runegear right?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cGood.\u201d They continued hastily to the second point they identified, the south wall, climbing down a very lengthy set of stairs and passing through a narrow walkway, before finally arriving. The patrolmen were nowhere to be found.</p>",
    "<p>It was a familiar scene. Pram sighed again. \u201cJust where are they socializing now?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir paused. He felt a strange, inexplicable uneasiness. Without warning, he broke out into a run, rushing forward along the wall, and barely recognized the shapes slumped against the wall. The guards were neither dozing off or socializing. They were dead.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMr. Desir?\u201d Pram\u2019s nerves carried in his voice.</p>",
    "<p>Desir looked down at the fallen guards. The snow had begun forming a thin sheet over the dead body, which meant that very little time had passed since the man had been killed. Desir grabbed the dead guard by the shoulders. He was cold as a block of ice. As Desir turned the man over, he saw an arrow embedded halfway through his stomach, dripping blood into a thick pool underneath. The notification appeared.</p>",
    "<p>[You\u2019ve discovered the Barbarians\u2019 infiltration.]</p>",
    "<p>The attack had already begun. They had executed the surprise attack to near perfection; Desir was certain that almost nobody else in Evernation even knew that they were under attack at the moment.</p>",
    "<p>Pram reflexively turned and began heading to the tower up ahead.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDuck!\u201d Desir yelled, as he pulled on Pram\u2019s scruff, sending him to the ground. A half dozen arrows zipped by overhead with a quiet, shrill whistle, before crashing against the stone walls with a crunch.</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026wha\u2026arrows? But how can they aim through this blizzard\u2026?\u201d Pram\u2019s voice was dazed.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWait a second Pram.\u201d Silently, Desir activated his magic.</p>",
    "<p>[Owl Vision]. A utility spell that allowed one to see clearly in the night. Carefully, Desir peered out between the crenellations. He saw a group of barbarians with their bodies almost totally hidden in the snowstorm.</p>",
    "<p>A single man, covered in the hide of a White Tiger caught his eye. He carried with one hand a great bow, nearly 2 meters long, and was at the head of the barbarians heading towards the wall.</p>",
    "<p>[You have encountered the Rare Hero, Bloody Talon. He is the tribal chief of the Hawk clan, and has managed to completely unite the previously fractured southern barbarians with his brilliant intellect. He is renowned as the greatest archer of the Hawk Clan.]</p>",
    "<p>\u201cA titan has arrived.\u201d Desir\u2019s voice was surprisingly calm. He watched as hooks shot towards the wall and latched on. Ropes dangled downward and were quickly grabbed by barbarians wearing white leopard hides. By Desir\u2019s estimate, there were about a hundred of them. It would be utter insanity to fight them. \u2018It\u2019d be nice if Ajest was here\u2026\u2019 He shook his head, and turned to face Pram.</p>",
    "<p>Pram\u2019s lips were pale. \u201cWe have to alert people.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cCorrect,\u201d agreed Desir. \u201cBut how\u2026?\u201d He turned his attention back to the guard tower. Guard Tower 13, as it was labeled, had a large bell attached to the top, whose purpose was to alert everyone in the event of an invasion. Unfortunately, the guard who was supposed to ring the bell had long since been turned into a porcupine thanks to the barbarians.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cTsk. Is there no other way?\u201d</p>"
