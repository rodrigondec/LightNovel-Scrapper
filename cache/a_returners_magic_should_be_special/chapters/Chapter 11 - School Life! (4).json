    "<p>As long as Pram approved, Desir was happy with it. At the same time, Desir noticed that Pram\u2019s face had become unnaturally red. Unable to understand why, Desir decided to ignore it and continued speaking, his tone belying his embarrassment. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to speak to me so politely, you know?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram\u2019s own face showed a steely determination as he responded, \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s fine, Mr. Desir. This is more comfortable to me.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe\u2019re the same age; \u2018mister\u2019 is a bit much, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNo, really it\u2019s fine. I want to call you Mr. Desir,\u201d Pram insisted. He appeared bizarrely resolute. Desir sighed a little inside, but, ultimately, decided to drop the topic. He could let Pram speak how he wished.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOh? It\u2019s this late already?\u201d blurted Desir in surprise. He had been so caught up in the conversation that he hadn\u2019t realized that the clock was already pointing at 1. It was lunch time.</p>",
    "<p>Having finished the first aid, Desir got up to move, but as he opened the door to leave, Pram suddenly moved in front of Desir and lowered his head. \u201cThank you for today, truly. I\u2019ll never forget this debt.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI only did what anyone would do in that situation,\u201d Desir responded.</p>",
    "<p>They left the infirmary together, and Pram spoke up again. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do to help, please tell me. You can ask me any time you\u2019d like.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir\u2019s brows suddenly furrowed. \u201cAnything you can do to help\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Noticing Desir\u2019s suddenly serious expression, Pram pressed, \u201cAnything at all!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Anything?\u2019 Desir\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cThen, Pram, if you haven\u2019t applied to a party yet, would you join mine?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram\u2019s eyes jumped in surprise, before his face broke into a wide smile of pure delight. \u201cOf course, Mr. Desir!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>And with that, Desir completed his party.</p>",
    "<p>Desir, Romantica, and Pram walked across the long, empty corridor, before coming to a stop in front of an elegant wooden door. An engraved plaque on the door read, \u2018Brigitte de Fahellibos.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>The door swung open, into a spacious and well-organized room, elegantly decorated. Atop a small table near the center, four tea cups were neatly sat, as if the professor had been expecting them.</p>",
    "<p>As the three entered the room, Professor Brigitte spoke. \"I'm afraid you've called to meet at a busy time.\"</p>",
    "<p>Desir, Romantica, and Pram sat opposite Brigitte. Desir bowed his head as he spoke. \u201cThank you for giving us the time, when you\u2019re so busy.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Brigitte positively beamed at Desir\u2019s words. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. There\u2019s nothing to worry about,\u201d she responded. She took a sip from her cup.</p>",
    "<p>Desir looked up, examining the familiar figure closely. She was a classic model of beauty and grace, with beautiful, pure eyes, and flawless white skin. Today, she wore a simple but elegant dress, perfectly complemented with a number of classy accessories. Clearly, her fashion sense was excellent. Desir knew Professor Brigitte well; when he was still an orphan, she had recommended him to Hebrion Academy. If it hadn\u2019t been for her, Desir would have spent his entire life at the orphanage, destitute. Ever since that day, he had remained deeply, sincerely grateful for her.</p>",
    "<p>Brigitte placed her teacup back down. \u201cYou were truly amazing at the entrance exam, Desir.\u201d She continued, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you do that before, you know?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir blushed as he responded, \u201cHaha, is that so?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cCertainly. That day was the first time I\u2019ve ever seen such skillful application of magic from you.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026It really wasn\u2019t that much.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou\u2019re humbling yourself too much,\u201d Brigitte insisted. \u201cYou won against the much favored Ajest, after all.\u201d Brigitte flashed a wide smile at Desir as she continued, \u201cRemembering how hopeless you were when I was first teaching you, I do feel quite betrayed at seeing how brilliant your magic is, huhuhu.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir froze, speechless, as a chill ran down his spine.</p>",
    "<p>Seeing this, Brigitte spoke up again. \u201cIt was a joke. Drink, before the tea cools. It took quite a bit of effort to get these leaves imported from Heidna.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201d Desir raised his cup. His hands were still shaking violently.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica looked at him while snickering quietly. She hadn\u2019t expected there was someone who could win against Desir with words.</p>",
    "<p>Her teacup now half empty, Brigitte gazed intently at the group. A mysterious light flickering across her eyes as she asked, \u201cSo these are the party members you\u2019ve found?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Without another word, Brigitte examined Romantica, Pram, and Desir one by one, only speaking again once she was satisfied. \u201cWhat\u2019s your reason for creating a party, Desir?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Of course, she was asking for the party\u2019s objective. Their goal was something that Desir saw clearly in his mind. In fact, he had created this very party for that single reason.</p>",
    "<p>With fire in his eyes, Desir said, \u201cMy goal is to move up to the Alpha Class through the promotion battle.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Brigitte raised an eyebrow in mild surprise. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be difficult you know?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOh, I know.\u201d Desir replied, his voice carrying an air of confidence.</p>",
    "<p>Pram, who had simply been listening in a daze, shakily raised his hand. When Brigitte finally looked at him, he spoke, \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018moving up to the Alpha Class\u2019?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAh, it seems you haven\u2019t been officially informed yet,\u201d said Brigitte, \u201cOur academy employs a system of advancement known as the \u2018promotion battles\u2019.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Promotion battles were what decided the Hebrion students\u2019 rankings each year. Not only were these battles a tradition of Hebrion Academy, they also acted as the students\u2019 midterm exams.</p>",
    "<p>The promotion battles started with a tournament phase, from which the top 30 participants were selected. These 30 students would enter an artificial Class 5 Shadow World and take part in a battle royale between one another, which would decide their final ranks. The main goal of everyone in this stage was to be one of the last people remaining, as the top 9 survivors received the title of \u2018Single Ranker\u2019.</p>",
    "<p>Brigitte continued her explanation, \u201cWhat Desir means by \u2018promotion\u2019 isn\u2019t only entering the Alpha Class, but also receiving the Single Ranker title through the tournament.\u201d She turned back towards Desir, and asked, \u201cAm I correct, Desir?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir nodded in affirmation. \u201cYes, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat!? What are you talking about!\u201d Romantica, who had been listening silently, shot up from her seat. \u201cForget being in the top 9. There\u2019s no way we could even place in the top 30 of the tournament. And even if we did, any Beta Class parties would be targeted by everyone else immediately!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cShe\u2019s right you know.\u201d Brigitte agreed, nodding. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious who will be in the top 30. The majority of them will be elites, all in large parties. Last year, there was the Blue Moon party with 15 members, the Red Dragon party with 9, and the remaining 6 were all from other Alpha Class parties. Not a single student from the Beta Class has ever placed in the top 30 in this academy\u2019s history.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Now with a better understanding of what Desir\u2019s plan entailed, Pram spoke warily, \u201cSo obviously, there\u2019s no way the Alpha Class will go easy on anyone from Beta Class, and they\u2019ll likely even target us.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat is correct.\u201d Desir said.</p>",
    "<p>The weak would always be targeted first. Furthermore, everyone in Desir\u2019s party was from the Beta Class. Even if they all somehow managed to make it into the top 30, they would be a huge disadvantage number-wise.</p>",
    "<p>But despite these overwhelmingly terrible odds, Desir looked confident. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s all the more important that we aim for becoming Single Rankers.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Currently, the Beta Class was nothing more than a collection of trash in the academy\u2019s eyes. Beta Class students were all commoners, meaning that the professors and Alpha Class students held them in contempt. Their future was apparent. The Beta Class students would lose any and all motivation sooner or later, and would eventually give up on graduating. The students who were seen only as trash would become exactly that. But what if it didn\u2019t have to be that way.</p>",
    "<p>Desir spoke with a smile. \u201cThink about it, professor. If the Beta Class who are thought of as trash wins Single Ranker titles for everyone in a 3-man party, how would people react?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d Brigitte\u2019s was unable to answer Desir, falling silent as the</p>",
    "<p>implications of his plans dawned on her.</p>",
    "<p>Desir continued, \u201c\u2018The Beta Class is talentless, so I refuse to teach them.\u2019 Opinions such as these would become mere excuses, and the truth would become apparent. The Beta Class will finally be able to remove their shackles of inferiority.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Steam rose from their cups, the tea within still warm, and its fragrance filled the room.</p>",
    "<p>Desir gulped nervously. Other than the occasional blink, Professor Brigitte sat as still as a statue, contemplating Desir\u2019s words quietly.</p>",
    "<p>As the three students held their breath in silence, Brigitte finally spoke, \u201cAlright then, I\u2019ll authorize the creation of your party.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>A sigh of relief escaped Desir. \u201cThank you, professor.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>However, before Desir could fully relax, Brigitte continued. \u201cBut before that, there\u2019s something I must be sure of.\u201d Brigitte looked at Pram and Romantica. \u201cI need to hear Pram and Romantica\u2019s consent.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram and Romantica each took a deep breath; they both understood the weight their decision would carry.</p>",
    "<p>Brigitte looked at the two of them sternly. \u201cYou must be absolutely certain before giving me an answer. Joining Desir\u2019s party also means agreeing with Desir\u2019s ideals. In other words, you\u2019re throwing in your lot with him. You must obey your party leader\u2019s commands, and follow his instructions at all times. To join this party under these constraints, what matters most of all is your own determination.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram showed no hesitation in reaching his decision. \u201cI will apply to join Mr. Desir\u2019s party.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Brigitte passed a paper over to Pram. \u201cThen please sign this contract.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The pen moved without reserve, and Brigitte picked up the completed contract.</p>",
    "<p>While quickly checking the contract in her hands, Brigitte said, \u201cNow there\u2019s only one person left.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>With that, everyone\u2019s gaze fell on a single person in the room.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica was holding her chin, lost in thought. She was currently holding a heated internal debate. Was it really possible to enter the Alpha Class this way? To reach the top 9 in the academy that gathered the greatest talents from around world. She was only a 2nd circle mage. The spellsword Ajest included, there were surely much more than 9 people who were easily stronger than her. To be honest, Romantica thought that even the notion of entering the Alpha Class was little more than a pipe dream. \u2018That is\u2026 if I were alone.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Romantica looked at Desir. What she saw was a man with overflowing confidence. His look was one that said \u2018there\u2019s no way I could possibly lose\u2019. It was as if defeat had never even crossed his mind. Looking at him, she recalled the time when he\u2019d taken control of her magic. It was truly a creative, even ingenious, way to use magic. It was the first time Romantica felt like she\u2019d caught a glimpse of an unreachable level. Her horizons were expanded that day, and she had decided to never allow herself to become conceited again. Romantica thought for certain that if it were Desir\u2026 if it were him, she felt he could create something incredible.</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026Whew.\u201d Romantica sighed deeply and turned to Brigitte. \u201cWhere do I sign?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The main building, located in the center of the academy\u2019s campus, was split into six unique sectors, and the distance between each sector was so great that magic-powered buses were necessary for transportation between them. Each sector was named after the purpose it served. The area containing the dormitories was called the Residential Sector, and the area that conducted magical research or research on Shadow Worlds was called the Research Sector; the other four sectors were named in a similar fashion.</p>",
    "<p>| This stop is the Training Sector.</p>",
    "<p>Desir, Romantica, and Pram got off the bus. In front of the station stood an ivory-colored marble statue of a swordsman. Behind it stood large buildings boasting an incredible height, rising far up into the sky. Walking side by side, Desir\u2019s group entered the training center.</p>"
