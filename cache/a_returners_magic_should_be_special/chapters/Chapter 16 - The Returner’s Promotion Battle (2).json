    "<p>In the past there had a group who had revolted against the Kingdom, under the name of \u2018Republic\u2019. They had rallied support through a common ideology: \u2018The Kingdom is a crumbling sandcastle and the nobles are its inhabitants\u2019.</p>",
    "<p>Doneta closed his eyes for a moment, then opened them slowly. \u201cSo you\u2019ll create another Republic. That\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to say?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf I wanted to lose my head, then maybe I\u2019d try that.\u201d Romantica shrugged. \u201cI was only talking about you people who scorn the commoners. You nobles who still fear them, even after more than 10 years since the Republic\u2019s destruction.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend like you actually understand. If you knew what really happened back then, on that day, you would never say that.\u201d Doneta gazed at Romantica. No, he was looking through her, as if she were a window to the past. \u201c12 years ago, a commoner student of Hebrion Academy struck the spark that lit the fire of revolution among the commoners, and raised up an army of rebels to destroy the Kingdom. They called themselves the Republic.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Yes, the rebel leader had been a graduate of the greatest academy on the continent, Hebrion.</p>",
    "<p>The Republic grew rapidly, and their advance was merciless; they ravaged every place they passed through.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAs the Republic and the Kingdom fought, the country became divided, and countless people were driven to ruin.\u201d As he continued to speak, Doneta\u2019s tone became more aggravated. \u201cEven the nobles were no exception; many families fell during that time.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>In the end, they were almost able to take the capital, where the great royal palace stood. But they defeated by the King\u2019s forces, putting an end to the commoner uprising.</p>",
    "<p>Doneta clenched his fist, his voice now seething with rage. \u201cMost of the Hadun family, my parents included, died that day the Republic attacked the capital. Beheaded by the guillotine to the cheers of thousands. I still can\u2019t forget the look they gave me, their gazes remained locked to mine the entire time, until their heads were lopped off.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just me, you know.\u201d Doneta\u2019s voice became calmer, and he looked Romantica in the eye. \u201cThere are so many among the nobles will never forget. To this day, the dregs of the Republic still remain, which means we cannot trust the commoners.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica grimaced, as she finally glimpsed the depths of Doneta\u2019s hatred. \u201cYou can\u2019t judge the whole based on the actions of a few. That's just irrational.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Doneta narrowed his eyes at Romantica\u2019s words. \u201cOf course not all of the commoners were part of the revolutionary army. But the revolutionary army was comprised solely of commoners.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica sighed, she realized there was no point in talking anymore. They were enemies now, and nothing she said was going to change that. \u201cGood, plenty of reason for us to be enemies. The nobles hate the commoners, and the commoners don\u2019t want to be discriminated against, that\u2019s all there is to it. We\u2019re trying to enter the Alpha Class, and you\u2019re trying to stop us.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The Alpha Class, no commoner had joined their ranks for the last 12 years. It had become a symbol of the nobility.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica rose from her seat. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for the day we meet in the Shadow World.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou won\u2019t make it.\u201d Doneta\u2019s eyes flashed menacingly. \u201cHow could commoners like you make it through the tournament? None of you will.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica smirked. \u201cReally now? I wonder?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Shards of glass exploded across the room. Ajest watched indifferently as black ink slowly spread over the floor. Professor Nifleka didn\u2019t bother hiding his anger. He crumpled the newspaper in his hands and threw it at the students in a rage; Ajest caught it as she was the closest.</p>",
    "<p>For the first time in 17 years, Beta Class students are in the top 30! On May 1st, these students will enter a Class 5 Shadow World to decide who amongst them is the strongest.</p>",
    "<p>As critics question the fairness of the Alpha and Beta division standards, the</p>",
    "<p>academy\u2019s board of directors refute\u2026</p>",
    "<p>Public opinion in the Kingdom sways towards the Republic\u2019s ideals that the monarchy is a relic of the past. The academy entrance committee in charge of the class of the 46th year states that hasty judgments should not\u2026</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThese Beta Class trash dare to\u2026!\u201d The atmosphere in the Blue Moon party office felt heavy. The students standing in front of Professor Nifleka all stood frozen. Getting on his nerves would have dire consequences on their future in the academy. His anger towards the Beta Class students gave them all the more reason to be careful.</p>",
    "<p>There were nine students in total in the office, with Ajest at their head. Twelve students should have been present, as there were exactly twelve students among the 1st years who had joined the Blue Moon party. If it weren\u2019t for that nameless party from the Beta Class, they would have all made it through the tournament</p>",
    "<p>Professor Nifleka\u2019s rage would not subside. \u201cThey would dare to mock the sanctity of the Alpha Class!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Nifleka slammed his fist down with all his might, and his desk shook as if it were about to break. Pugman Nifleka was the director of the Blue Moon party, the greatest and most famous party in Hebrion Academy. He expected nothing but perfection from the members of such a prestigious party, and this unexpected failure had focused his rage entirely onto one person.</p>",
    "<p>The student who had stolen a prospective Blue Moon party member from them. The same student who was in the Beta Class, but was aiming for the Alpha Class. The student who had stood out so much in the entrance exam.</p>",
    "<p>Professor Nifleka said the student\u2019s name, his voice oozing with bloodlust. \u201cDesir Arman!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir\u2019s name echoed throughout the room. Pugman was in a rage, his eyes were bloodshot, and veins pulsed on his neck. \u201cTo think we have to take this humiliation from that b*tch because of him.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>There was only one person in the entire academy who Pugman would call \u2018b*tch\u2019. Professor Brigitte Redwen, the target of his long-standing hatred.</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Ajest stared at Professor Nifleka indifferently. Even the director\u2019s rage was of no concern to her. In fact, this situation was to her benefit.</p>",
    "<p>Ajest focused on a single thing Nifleka had said. She whispered it to herself after tuning out the raging professor. \u201cDesir Arman\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>A wave of heat swept across her body. Her heart began beating strongly, as if it were trying to break out of her chest. Ajest forcibly held still her shaking hands.</p>",
    "<p>She hadn\u2019t forgotten it even once. How could she? She still couldn\u2019t let go of the bitter taste of her first defeat. Desir Arman had won against her, and that fact had been engraved into her mind. The memory of her loss had at some point morphed into a burning desire to win. But Desir had been assigned to the Beta Class, and her hopes of a rematch had only grown further away. She\u2019d started to think she\u2019d never meet him again.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Desir is coming.\u2019 A light flashed across her previously ice-cold eyes. He had returned to her. He had overcome all the odds and would come fight her once more. \u2018I can finally fight against him again.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>While Ajest was lost in thought, Nifleka continued on. \u201cIt\u2019s still fine. All that\u2019s left for us to do is to stop those insects from becoming Single Rankers. Our Blue Moon party will henceforth use any method at our disposal to eliminate Desir Arman\u2019s party. Your final ranks don\u2019t matter, as long as they fail.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Nifleka wouldn\u2019t stop at mere threats. \u201cSo, with that out of the way, let's move on. Now that I think about it, we haven\u2019t chosen a leader yet.\u201d Nifleka looked</p>",
    "<p>over the party for a moment. His eyes stopped on Ajest. \u201dYou\u2019ve fought Desir before, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest finally spoke, \u201cYes.\u201d The professor\u2019s question had dragged her back to reality.</p>",
    "<p>Nifleka\u2019s gaze sharpened. \u201cThen you should more or less know how to deal with him already.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve thought of a few methods.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest was someone who excelled in every field. When someone as skilled as her said she had a method to deal with Desir Arman, Nifleka\u2019s eyes shone with glee. \u201cGood, that\u2019s more than enough. Ajest Kingscrown, I appoint you as the leader of the Blue Moon party\u2019s 1st year group.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Selecting the group leader so hastily was shocking to the students present, but not a single one of them objected.</p>",
    "<p>Ajest Kingscrown: a Spellsword, a Pawn-rank knight, and a 3rd circle mage on top of that. Peerless in politics, history, and every other field; she was the subject of awe and admiration. It was only natural that nobody would doubt her abilities.</p>",
    "<p>Professor Nifleka looked upon Ajest with a smile. \u201cDo your utmost to eliminate Desir Arman\u2019s party.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>His words clearly had a more insidious undertone, but Ajest Kingscrown was happy nonetheless. She would absolutely beat Desir this time around. The situation was similar to when she was with Elheim, but now Ajest Kingscrown\u2019s mindset was completely different. She no longer thought of Desir as a weakling; instead, he had become someone she had to unquestionably defeat.</p>",
    "<p>He had become her rival.</p>",
    "<p>Desir spoke, smiling from ear to ear. \u201cFirst, I want to congratulate both of you for a job well done. At this rate, we\u2019ll pass the final stage of the tournament with flying colors.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Still smiling, Desir dropped a small stack of books on the table, causing dust to fly everywhere. There were three books. An incident timeline, the structure of the Privius Clock Tower, and finally an analysis of the creation of the Republic in 1218. Each book was large and thick with pages.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat is all this?\u201d Romantica asked.</p>",
    "<p>Even though it was the lounge, it was still disrespectful to make such loud noises in a library. Pram raised a finger to his lips to shush her. Romantica flinched, but her stubborn nature wouldn\u2019t let her admit she was in the wrong, so she snorted in reply.</p>",
    "<p>Desir spoke, wearing his usual enigmatic smile. \u201cStarting today, we won\u2019t be training anymore.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica and Pram went wide-eyed at Desir\u2019s words. This was the first time they\u2019d ever skipped training since the formation of their party. But of course, Desir had no intention of letting them rest. \u201cWe\u2019re going to study history today.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHuuh? History?\u201d Romantica frowned. She wasn\u2019t pleased. Not pleased at all. Suddenly studying history? \u2018What kind of stupid idea is this\u2019, she wondered.</p>",
    "<p>Desir chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s actually very important. It\u2019s because we need to learn the original history of the Class 5 Shadow World we\u2019re entering.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Class 5 Shadow Worlds always required proper planning.</p>",
    "<p>Class 7s had simple objectives, such as travelling from point A to point B or gathering objects.</p>",
    "<p>From Class 6 and onwards, the Shadow Worlds became fashioned after historical events and settings. For example, traveling with a knight, or guarding a caravan in a time period before the invention of modern vehicles, when trade relied upon such archaic methods of transportation. Understanding and preparing for the time period was one of the most crucial elements in clearing a Shadow World. Class 5 Shadow Worlds were all copies of certain historical events, most of them important enough to be recorded in the history books.</p>",
    "<p>Desir stroked his hand across the cover of the history book. \u201cBy clearing a Shadow World, we can obtain magic crystals. This magic crystal contains all the information about the Shadow World it comes from. The Shadow World being used in this promotion battle will be one such reproduction of an already cleared Shadow World.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir continued, \u201cThat means the conditions can be controlled. Safeguards are an example of this.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram nodded his head in understanding. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about the Shadow World we went through during the entrance exam.\u201d</p>"
