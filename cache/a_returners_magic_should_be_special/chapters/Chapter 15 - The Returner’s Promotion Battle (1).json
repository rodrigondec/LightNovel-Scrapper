    "<p>But nothing happened. The barbarian felt no resistance as the glaive completed its sweeping downwards arc. The only thing he had struck was air.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cGruuh\u2026?\u201d The barbarian stared quizzically at Pram. He hadn\u2019t cut so much as a single hair on his head. A glint of silver was now jutting out from the wooden wall behind Pram. Something sharp with the silhouette of a crescent curve. The barbarian snapped his neck down to look at the glaive in his hands. Except, it wasn\u2019t a glaive anymore\u2014the blade was cut clean off. He was left with a wooden rod.</p>",
    "<p>Pram raised his rapier. \u201cShall we go again?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The barbarian flung the wooden handle aside and closed the distance with a swing of his fist. In an instant, his knuckles were close enough to obscure Pram\u2019s entire head from view. Pram wove to the side, letting the punch rocket past him like a battering ram, and seamlessly vaulted into the air with a backflip. With all the grace of a seasoned acrobat, he landed behind the bewildered giant, and followed up with a swing of his rapier.</p>",
    "<p>The giant spun around and raised an arm to block the blow with his gauntlet, but Pram\u2019s rapier drew a perfect arc around his guard, and thrust into the pit of his stomach. The now hapless giant tried to retreat, but Pram was faster. The rapier plunged into the barbarian\u2019s solar plexus. Tough as his body may have been, it was a decisive blow to a vulnerable weak point. The giant\u2019s body quavered, his legs gave out from under him, and he collapsed into a crumpled heap.</p>",
    "<p>Desir nodded silently, as if confirming something he\u2019d already known. \u201cLooks like it\u2019s over.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d screeched Ujukun. \u201cThat door is made of Kichlean steel. There\u2019s only one person here who can open it, and I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s in no condition to do so.\u201d Kichlean steel was famed for its unyielding tensile strength. It was also proportionately heavy. A door of this size would likely require the strained</p>",
    "<p>efforts of half a dozen men to even budge. \u201cWhich means you\u2019re stuck here until my guards arrive,\u201d cackled Ujukun.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know about that.\u201d The Blanchume rapier streaked through the air, making short work of the door\u2019s hinges. The door flattened with a thunderous crash. Apparently, even Kichlean steel was no match for Blanchume. As the pair made their exit, Desir turned to the dazed Ujukun. \u201cLooks like it\u2019s definitely over now, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>They\u2019d only been running for a few minutes but Desir was already out of breath.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAlright, I think we\u2019ve lost them. I really need to exercise some more. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m this weak\u2026\u201d Desir muttered between stilted breaths. Though, his lack of breath did little to damper is cheerful voice. \u201cGood thing we got the sword back, right?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>While nodding, Pram moved his hand to the rapier at his waist without even realizing it. The pale rapier glittered like starlight, or even moonlight. He pulled out the sword, and couldn\u2019t feel the slightest weight. A truly incredible feeling.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve decided to use the rapier?\u201d Desir said, recalling how Pram had fought with the rapier a few minutes before.</p>",
    "<p>He\u2019d held the rapier, and subdued the barbarian giant with overwhelming skill. The fact that Pram had took up the rapier again was especially meaningful to Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe situation was too urgent so I had no choice, but\u2026\u201d Pram was still hesitating. He eventually let out a sigh. \u201cWhy would my father hide something like this in that old, worn-down Kemubin?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>That was the cause of this entire ridiculous incident. If he\u2019d made it obvious from the start that it was in fact a Kemubin, Pram would never have had any reason to resent his father.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYour father made a wise choice, Pram.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram raised his head at Desir\u2019s words.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cA Blanchume sword is an incredible thing. Imagine if word got out that you owned it. Over a hundred people just like Ujukun would have come to hound you,\u201d explained Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBut there was still a chance I would never have found out,\u201d said Pram.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHe left it behind because he thought you\u2019d figure it out eventually,\u201d said Desir assuredly. Pram\u2019s father always believed that Pram would realize, as long as he kept carrying the rapier around.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d asked Pram.</p>",
    "<p>Desir grabbed the rapier, and pointed at the grip. Pram looked at it. On the Kemubin that had the shape of an old, worn sword, there were written some unreadable words. The reason they were unreadable was because they were incomplete. When the Blanchume was revealed and the rapier showed its true form, the words on the grip took shape. It looked like there was a hidden mechanism on the grip as well as the blade.</p>",
    "<p>Pram read the words slowly.</p>",
    "<p>Do not lose your way, my little bird.</p>",
    "<p>The Alpha Class\u2019s private restaurant was on a high floor, the view overlooking Hebrion Academy. A cold breeze blew in from the open window. A colorless night view lay outside. The stars shone solemnly in the deep dark.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica shuddered in the cold.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHere\u2019s your order, madam,\u201d said the waiter.</p>",
    "<p>The lights glittered yellow and the waiters moved between the tables like birds flying in and out of their nests. The menu was seafood\u2014a salt-grilled fish and a crab gratin were laid in front of Romantica, and she thanked the waiter with a smile.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe Alpha Class meals are so much better, right?\u201d said Doneta Hadun, seated across from her.</p>",
    "<p>She hadn\u2019t known that he\u2019d arrived. She guessed he\u2019d come while she was looking out the window. There was nothing strange about the fact that he was there. In fact, what was strange was the fact that she was here. Without the man sitting across from her, she could never have even set foot in this place.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAt long last. I\u2019ve wanted to see you all this time,\u201d said Doneta warmly.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI see,\u201d responded Romantica curtly. Romantica waited for Doneta\u2019s food to come out. A moment later, Doneta\u2019s food was laid in front of him, and they both raised their forks. The grilled fish tasted good, and the gratin was slightly greasy, but its flavor was exquisite. The two of them didn\u2019t say anything for a while, savoring the food.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo, what did you want to talk about?\u201d asked Doneta.</p>",
    "<p>There was no reason to hesitate. Romantica placed a wooden dagger on the table. It was decorated with all sorts of ornaments. Romantica explained herself, \u201cI came to return this.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Doneta pushed up his glasses and looked at the Kemubin as if it were his first time seeing it. Romantica pushed the Kemubin toward him. Doneta showed no reaction for a moment. No rage, no annoyance. He merely collected his breath, and pondered why he had gotten rejected. Only a third-rate noble would show his emotions on his face. \u201cI thought there was no reason for you to refuse-\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou thought.\u201d Romantica looked at Doneta with her wind-touched green eyes.</p>",
    "<p>Doneta\u2019s heart started racing as he looked back at her gaze. \u201cIf you\u2019re perhaps uncomfortable with dating me, you don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI did hesitate for that reason at the beginning. But it\u2019s not because of that,\u201d said Romantica.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou mean there\u2019s another reason?\u201d asked Doneta.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica nodded. \u201cI joined a nameless party in the Beta Class.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBeta Class\u2026\u201d Doneta looked at her with disbelief. He mumbled to himself, as though he couldn\u2019t even understand what he had just heard. \u201cBeta Class, you say\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes. A commoner\u2019s party. The people you regard as trash,\u201d said Romantica.</p>",
    "<p>Doneta slammed his fork on the table. Everything had grown cold. The air blowing in from the window, the soup on the table, the atmosphere between them. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Did you get blackmailed?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d Romantica shook her head. \u201cNo, this was my decision.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThen you weren\u2019t thinking rationally,\u201d said Doneta. He opened the Kemubin. A golden necklace slid out into Doneta\u2019s palm like a snake.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any regrets,\u201d said Romantica. She stared at Doneta with renewed vigor.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be hasty. There\u2019s still time,\u201d smiled Doneta.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m not taking back my decision.\u201d Doneta\u2019s lips were upturned, but he wasn\u2019t smiling. Romantica did the same. \u201cI honestly think I made the right choice. I didn\u2019t want to join that party at first, but I changed my mind as time went on. This party is fun. The leader trains us diligently. My skills are improving quickly thanks to him.\u201d With each word, Romantica became more sure that she made the correct choice.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf it\u2019s improving your skills, our party can do that as well,\u201d refuted Doneta.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOf course, that\u2019s only one of the reasons. Doneta, do you remember how you told me the Beta Class were all worthless commoners, nothing but trash?\u201d asked Romantica.</p>",
    "<p>Doneta paused. \u201cI don\u2019t see why you\u2019re bringing that up.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe reason,\u201d explained Romantica. She breathed in deeply filled up her lungs. Glittering red snake eyes stared back at her. She breathed out, and said the words that sealed her fate. \u201c\u2026is that I\u2019m a commoner.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Doneta slammed his fork down into the table. A sharp clang slammed into Doneta\u2019s eardrums. All of the concern and affection washed off of his face. A slight look of scorn could be seen on his face. Romantica could no longer find the slightest affection in his eyes.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHm.\u201d He let out a slight cough. In a split second, he regained his poker face after realizing his mistake, but it was too late. His feelings toward commoners was close to physical repulsion, and he couldn\u2019t contain it immediately. Just as somebody wouldn\u2019t need a reason to hate cockroaches, he didn\u2019t need a reason to hate commoners. A look of panic showed on his face\u2014he looked desperate. \u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYour reason for thinking that?\u201d asked Romantica.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf you were truly a commoner, you would have kept your mouth shut and joined my party. That would be the only way a commoner like you could have entered the Alpha Class,\u201d explained Doneta.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Romantica admitted it. \u201cBut when they found out I was a commoner, at least they didn\u2019t look at me like you.\u201d Doneta was right\u2014if she joined the Blue Moon Party, she would have an easy time entering the Alpha Class. In contrast, Desir instead invited her to his party even though he knew she was a commoner. There was no discrimination. She didn\u2019t have to lie, or fear that she would be outed for being a commoner.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI see.\u201d Doneta opened his mouth. \u201cOf course. You\u2019re all the same trash, after all.\u201d His bitter tone was reflected in his demeanor.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cTrash\u2026 you\u2019ve got that right,\u201d said Romantica. Her voice carried the same bitterness as Doneta\u2019s, as she answered him, her voice filled with remorse. \u201cNobles will always hate commoners. They hate and despise them as if they\u2019re biological enemies. I know very well why you nobles can\u2019t stand commoners.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same reason Hebrion Academy is an aristocracy instead of a meritocracy\u2014the same reason why Alpha and Beta aren\u2019t divided based on rank, but status. The reason is that you nobles are afraid of the birth of a new Republic.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026Watch your mouth.\u201d Doneta whispered back immediately. His eyes shifted side to side and he looked around to make sure nobody was paying attention.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica ignored him and laid the final nail in the coffin. \u201cTimes have changed. The Shadow Worlds have toppled the balance. Anyone strong enough can acquire magic crystals. You\u2019re all living in a castle of sand and it\u2019s crumbling.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Her voice now reinvigorated, Romantica said, \u201cYou live in constant fear, not knowing when everything will collapse.\u201d</p>"
