    "<p>\u201cSo annoying!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica threw her quill pen down at the table. Ink splattered all over, drenching various sheets of paper with the black liquid.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhy am I working as a merchant?\u201d sighed Romantica, closing her eyes. Upon arriving in the Shadow World, she became the head of a small-sized company that was financially unstable. Her quest was to fulfill her duty as the head and revive the company.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica leaned back in her chair, swaying back and forth.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Even if I\u2019m used to dealing with this kind of work\u2026\u2019</p>",
    "<p>The Eru family was originally a merchant family before they became nobles. Across the continent, they were known as famous merchants and were even acknowledged by the Frillecha Empire. It goes without saying that they have tremendous wealth and influence. They were even able to buy their way into nobility.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica\u2019s grandfather was a true merchant down to his bones. He had taught her all the skills necessary to survive as a merchant. Romantica learned economics, finance, accounting, and even the art of persuasion. She was even given funds to run her own business in order to learn the practical skills necessary to operate a company.</p>",
    "<p>This was why it wasn\u2019t difficult for her to manage a small-sized company.</p>",
    "<p>Utilizing her knowledge and talent, Romantica managed to refinance and revive the company in a mere four days. The company was on the path of rapid growth under her tenure.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018So far so good.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>While it was true that her experiences helped her progress quickly, a problem arose shortly after she revived the company.</p>",
    "<p>There was no follow up quest.</p>",
    "<p>Additionally, there was another issue. Her party members.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhere did Desir and Pram go? Where did they go, leaving me behind all alone!?\u201d Romantica slammed the table with her fist in a rage.</p>",
    "<p>After entering the Shadow World, Romantica was separated from her party. At first, she wasn\u2019t concerned, since she thought they would meet up shortly after. However, she was wrong. It had been 8 days since she entered the Shadow World and she still could not find anyone.</p>",
    "<p>Currently, Romantica was located in the Kervan Territory. She had deployed people to look for her party members, hoping that they were somewhere within the territory, but they found no one that looked remotely like them, not even Ajest.</p>",
    "<p>And thus, being unable to find her party members or receive a quest, Romantica was stuck.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018How did this happen?\u2019  Romantica slumped onto the table and let out another sigh.</p>",
    "<p>Recovering a bit, she began to sway back and forth in her chair out of habit.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018I wish I had someone who could tell me how to progress or let me know if this entire situation was normal\u2026\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Romantica felt uneasy with all this uncertainty.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018What am I supposed to do\u2026This is so frustrating. If only Desir was here, I wish\u2026\u2019</p>",
    "<p>As Romantica\u2019s thoughts inadvertently drifted to Desir, her heart skipped a beat.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOh my god! What am I thinking about?\u201d Romantica\u2019s face became bright red.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Why did I think about him so suddenly? That demon!\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Romantica covered her blushing cheeks with her hands. She was fully aware of how foolish she looked at this moment. However, she still felt that it was necessary to hide her embarrassment. If someone had found out that she was blushing because of Desir\u2026</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBoss!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cUwaaaaak!\u201d Romantica lost her balance and fell off her chair with a crash.</p>",
    "<p>She hit her head on the floor and a sharp pain rattled her skull. Romantica rubbed the back of her head as she slowly stood up.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEmil! Didn\u2019t I tell you knock before you enter!?\u201d yelled Romantica, with tears dripping from her eyes.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHow many times have I told you to be more mindful.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Seeing the youth in front of her prostrate himself so much, she felt sorry for him. Romantica repositioned the chair and sat down.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo? Why are you here so early in the morning?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAh, you see\u2026the price of the woven fabric you ordered us to purchase spiked today!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAs expected. I was thinking that it was about time for that to happen.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHowever, I was wondering how you knew.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhy are you even reporting something so trivial like that. Didn\u2019t I tell you it was going to happen?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou did. Even so\u2026I couldn\u2019t believe what I saw today.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about analyzing, okay? Isn\u2019t that what I\u2019ve been telling you guys to do? If you can properly analyze the data, it\u2019s easy to see which products in the market will become popular.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBut boss, that\u2019s easier said than done.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. I will admit that I\u2019m quite talented.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHaha boss. It sounds lame when you say it yourself\u2026\u201d The youth trailed off once he saw Romantica glaring at him, \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica let out a sigh. She couldn\u2019t find it in her to get angry.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo? Is that all you wanted to report?</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m here to report on one more thing. Ahem,\u201d said Emil, adapting a serious expression as he cleared his throat, \u201cBoss, a few days ago, didn\u2019t you tell us to research the Holy City?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Goatheim, the Holy City. Before it was swallowed by the Shadow World, it was the capital city of the Holy Empire of Artemis. As the capital city, Goatheim was densely populated. As such, a large amount of commodities were traded within the city.</p>",
    "<p>It was common knowledge that businesses would flourish in such big cities, so Romantica had planned to enter the capital city of the Holy Empire. However, this was unrelated to her quest. It was something she was planning to do on her own accord.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve completed our research and concluded that now is not the best time to do business in the Holy City.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIs that so? With the volume of commodities being traded, I thought it would be the opposite.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cCurrently the tax rates are at an all time high. Additionally, people are hesitant to come out and shop because of strange rumors. As such, many companies have already left the capital.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cStrange rumors?\u201d asked Romantica. Emil nodded and gulped before continuing.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThere are rumors of a demon kidnapping people who are out alone at night. The demon would skin the person alive and eat them.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cPfff.\u201d Romantica covered her mouth as she started to laugh. Seeing her reaction, Emil\u2019s shoulders slumped.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI knew you would laugh boss.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf you have time to spread rumors, go work instead.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m serious! While it\u2019s difficult to confirm if this demon exists, it seems like someone is really kidnapping people. There has been numerous reports of mothers asking people to help find their missing children.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHm\u2026so you\u2019re saying that rumor is not baseless.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cTo make matters worse, the Empire is imposing a hefty tax on the populace, saying that it\u2019s to prevent God\u2019s punishment. They are even arresting anyone who speaks against the Pope. The situation is no laughing matter.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, wouldn\u2019t there be a lot of people leaving the city?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAh, yes. A lot of people have left the capital and are becoming vagrants.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cVagrants, huh?\u201d Romantica did not miss that term. She picked up her quill pen and made a note of it, \u201cI\u2019m not certain about the other things you mentioned, but I should definitely follow up on this. Since our territory isn\u2019t that far from the capital, there should be a lot of them coming here.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI doubt many would come into our territory. Our lord issued strict orders to not accept any vagrants.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica loosened the grip on her pen.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHmmm\u2026the lord is quite cold hearted.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHe made a wise decision. If vagrants were to flood our territory, the public order would be in disarray and a lot of problems would arise. If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s better not to accept them in the first place.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Hmmm\u2026so is that how things are done in this era?\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Deep down, Romantica wanted to scold Emil. However, she did not. If this was the popular opinion of this period of time, she knew her words would not change anything.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf so, wouldn\u2019t all the vagrants die in this cold winter?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not the case. There is a territory in the north that is accepting all vagrants.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the territory?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEvernatten.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEvernatten? I feel like I\u2019ve heard that before.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s the frontline territory between the barbarians and us. Lord Evernatten is famous, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll figure out a solution to the problem.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIs he that famous?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOf course. He\u2019s one of those rare men of integrity that\u2019s hard to find these days. When he was still active in the capital, he scored a victory against the Hebrion Empire, expanding our territory past the river. Sadly, he made a bad impression with the Pope and was banished to Evernatten.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEmil, bring me the map,\u201d Romantica crossed her arms, her merchant\u2019s instinct tingling. Something was fishy. Emil brought over the map and she opened it. She went over each territory\u2019s name with her finger.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEvernatten\u2026Evernatten\u2026Here it is!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>It was a small territory, just an outcropping of land bordering the northern barbarian territory. Once Romantica located Evernatten an announcement appeared with a chime.</p>",
    "<p>[You have started the Main Quest: Evernatten\u2019s Survival]</p>",
    "<p>[Solve Evernatten\u2019s two problems:</p>",
    "<p>-Barbarians (Progress 100%): A peace treaty was made with the barbarian chief, Bloody Talon. The barbarians will not perceive Evernatten as an enemy anymore.</p>",
    "<p>-Vagrants (Progress 30%): Public order has been restored and crime rates have fallen significantly. The residents of the territory feel secure walking around the streets. Vagrants cannot commit any crimes due to strict oversight.]</p>",
    "<p>\u2018My instincts told me to investigate the capital city and I managed to get information on the vagrant situation. This, in turn, led to knowledge of Evernatten which showed me the Main Quest!\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Romantica shivered with excitement.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018The quest has progressed quite a bit. They must all be there, I\u2019m certain of it.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Having finally found a clue, Romantica immediately stood up.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEmil, I have an urgent job for you.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat is it boss?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cInvestigate the situation in Evernatten.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to do business in Evernatten.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHow can you decide so suddenly? Did you even consider the distance between us and Evernatten?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, pack your bags now. It\u2019s not too late to start investigating once we arrive there.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Emil wasn\u2019t sure what the point of pre-investigation was if they were already going.</p>"
