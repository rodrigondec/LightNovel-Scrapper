    "<p>The Killdra Mouse leaped into the air with its mouth wide open, trying not to miss even a drop of Desir\u2019s blood.</p>",
    "<p>[Wind Bullet.]</p>",
    "<p>Romantica seized the opportunity. Wordlessly, she quickly formed a Wind Bullet and shot it straight into the mouse\u2019s belly. A large crack sounded\u2014but there was something off about the sound.</p>",
    "<p>The exoskeleton covering the rat\u2019s body had definitely broken, but the mouse hadn\u2019t died. Either the exoskeleton was stronger than she\u2019d thought, or her nerves had broken her concentration. Either way, the plan had failed. The Killdra Mouse fell back down and retreated into the torrent of rats. It was impossible to get to it now.</p>",
    "<p>Suddenly, Pram sped past Romantica.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cPram!?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Faster than Romantica or Desir could react, Pram dove into the rolling mass of rats, and thousands of rodents immediately began ravaging Pram\u2019s skin. But it wasn't enough to break Pram\u2019s concentration.</p>",
    "<p>The Killdra Mouse couldn\u2019t pass up the smell of blood. It moved quickly through the swarm. With his keen eyesight, Pram spotted the demon as it made its way towards him. \u201cHaap!\u201d He stabbed at it, his sword splitting the wave of rats like a beam.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSqueeee\u2026 eeeeak.\u201d A silver light pierced through the dark mass of rodents. The grotesque sound of skewered flesh echoed out. The Killdra Mouse, pierced by Pram\u2019s rapier, shivered and went limp. The rodent swarm, which had</p>",
    "<p>previously operated like a well-oiled machine, suddenly devolved into an incoherent mess. \u201cSqueak? Squeeeak?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>As if they\u2019d just woken from a dream, the rats looked around for a moment, dazed. But when their eyes landed on the gigantic humans next to them, they scattered back into the forest like a retreating tide.</p>",
    "<p>| Survival quest complete. You have defeated the Killdra Mouse. Survival</p>",
    "<p>success.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d Pram breathed out and collapsed on the spot.</p>",
    "<p>Desir flicked away the remaining rats clambering on Pram\u2019s shoulders. \u201cGood job, Pram.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis much\u2026 is nothing.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Everything had returned to normal, as if nothing had even happened. The ear- splitting sound of rats was nowhere to be heard. The rain, indifferent to the fierce battle that had just taken place, poured relentlessly on their faces and bodies.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cCold.\u201d Romantica muttered, her entire body soaked to the bone. She looked like a soggy rat.</p>",
    "<p>Desir smiled, and pointed northwest. \u201cIt should be a bit better over there.\u201d The thunder rumbled, and the clock tower, far to the northwest, cast a long shadow on the ground.</p>",
    "<p>| The quest objective has been revealed. You already possess knowledge of this</p>",
    "<p>place. The quest description has been altered to account for this.</p>",
    "<p>| The Privius Clock Tower is a large-scale magic device containing the highest level of dark magic. Each hour, it will summon a demon that can summon other demons. The summoned demons will each have unique characteristics depending on when they are summoned.</p>",
    "<p>| The final quest has been revealed.</p>",
    "<p>[Quest objective: Stop the clock tower.]</p>",
    "<p>| At the top of the clock tower lies the clock\u2019s power source. Destroy the power</p>",
    "<p>source, and the clock tower will stop.</p>",
    "<p>The sharp ring of a sword slash rang out, and the frozen Killdra Mouse shattered into pieces. Blood and meat danced together in a macabre waltz as its corpse fell to the ground. Ajest, cold and indifferent, flicked the blood off her sword.</p>",
    "<p>| You have defeated the Killdra Mouse. Survival success.</p>",
    "<p>The rats had been surrounding the Blue Moon party, pushing in from all sides. But after the boss rodent perished, they stopped in their tracks, and soon scattered; their cowardly natures restored themselves after being freed from the control of the Killdra Mouse.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe\u2019re alive!\u201d \u201cWe won!\u201d Excited cheers rang out from the group.</p>",
    "<p>Ajest looked around. There had been ten party members, including herself. That number had been reduced to eight. \u2018Two eliminated.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Overall, out of the 30 participants in this quest, over 10 had been eliminated\u2014 more than a third. The Blue Moon party had put up a decent fight\u2026 but Ajest\u2019s mood had soured, though nobody noticed the change in her emotions because of her indifferent expression.</p>",
    "<p>Percival walked toward Ajest. \u201cWe have the lead now. Almost half of the 18 survivors are in our party.\u201d Mathematically, the remaining survivors could only be small parties of three to five people. \u201cOnce we take care of the other parties, we\u2019re guaranteed to rank first.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The rain was still falling. The water soaked their bodies, washing away the sweat. It was a refreshing feeling after their long fight against the rats. Ajest\u2019s silver hair blew in the wind. It was a weak north wind, blowing in with the rain. One couldn\u2019t even feel it without paying attention.</p>",
    "<p>At that moment, Ajest\u2019s eyes flashed open.</p>",
    "<p>[Telbricsa\u2019s shield of ice protect us.]</p>",
    "<p>Magic formulas formed in front of Ajest at an incredible speed. Within a matter of seconds, a transparent pillar of ice emerged in front of Percival. As soon as it reached full height, the ice pillar shattered and fell over.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWha, what was that just now?\u201d Percival\u2019s voice shook.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSniper.\u201d There was no trace of any emotion in her voice, but Ajest also felt some shock. It was because there was barely any gap between the detection magic\u2014the wind\u2014and the snipe. If she hadn\u2019t noticed the detection magic, Percival would have been eliminated right there.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018There shouldn\u2019t be any mages here capable of casting this quickly\u2026\u2019 More accurately, there was nobody with that level of skill among the freshmen, herself excluded. Regardless of her expectations, the important thing was that a high-level wind mage was targeting them. And no matter how skilled her Alpha Class teammates were, a sniper of this level was incredibly dangerous. Ajest</p>",
    "<p>commanded the party members standing behind her. \u201cEnemy. Tankers in front. Wind mages, disrupt the air currents.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Her team moved into the defensive formation, following Ajest\u2019s orders. The tankers stood in front, shields out. The mages stood behind them, disrupting the air and preparing to counterattack.</p>",
    "<p>\u2026But no more attacks came. The enemy had likely realized that sniping was pointless without the element of surprise. So Ajest\u2019s party kept waiting, but to no avail.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cLeader? They\u2019re not sniping us\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHold formation.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>They couldn\u2019t release the formation just because the enemy had stopped sniping. The sniper would blow away their heads if the Blue Moon party lowered their guard for even a second.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDo not relax. Advance north.\u201d Ajest pointed in the direction the bullet had come from.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMages capable of casting detection spells, cast them every 100 meters.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The Blue Moon party advanced, their nerves stretched tight. The rain fell, the wind howled. For the vulnerable party, the weather conditions couldn\u2019t be any worse.</p>",
    "<p>Ajest bit her lip. \u2018I\u2019ve failed.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>From the third floor of the clock tower, Romantica looked out the window at the forest below, eyes furrowed in frustration. Desir stood next to her. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I didn\u2019t expect the snipe to work as long as Ajest was there.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat? You told me to snipe them knowing it wouldn\u2019t work?\u201d Romantica scowled and puffed up her cheeks.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes. To tell them that we have a sniper on our side. They\u2019ll have to spend every moment looking out for a snipe as they move, and they\u2019ll have to constantly use detection magic to prepare for it. That alone should be a huge mental burden for them.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica released the air from her cheeks, but she still wasn't convinced. \u201cSince the snipe failed, they\u2019ve found our location.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAnd that is the core of the plan.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir spoke again. \u201cSnipe every party, not just the Blue Moon party. Let them know our location.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica\u2019s shrill voice berated him. \u201cDid you hit your head?\u201d Desir smiled in response.</p>",
    "<p>Their objective was to lower the number of survivors below ten, whatever it took. Of course, since the Blue Moon party held the majority, it was impossible to avoid an eventual conflict with them. There was no way his group could win against the Blue Moon party in a direct confrontation. \u201cBut a melee\u2019s a different story.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cA melee?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe make every party fight at the same time, right here, in this clock tower.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>That was the best option for their party, considering their small number. \u201cRight now, the Blue Moon party has an absolute advantage. But what would happen if every party gathers here? There\u2019s no way the other survivors will fight each other when there\u2019s such a powerful group sitting right there. They\u2019ll team up against the overwhelming enemy.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir paused to breathe, then continued. \u201cWhen that melee happens, we\u2019ll balance them out. We\u2019ll take out any enemies if we have the chance. If we see one side winning, we\u2019ll tip the scales toward the other side. We\u2019ll slowly reduce the number of survivors down to nine.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIn other words, we make them work for us,\u201d Pram concluded.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHow scummy of you, Desir.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir raised an eyebrow at Romantica\u2019s insult, and spoke with a smirk. \u201cWhat matters is that we win, right?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram folded his arms. \u201cBut if we use that strategy, it\u2019ll be so unfair for the other parties. After coming all the way here while defending themselves at the same time, they\u2019ll be stuck in a huge melee. It\u2019ll truly be hell for them.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be heaven for us?\u201d A peculiar twinkle flashed in Desir\u2019s eyes.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica shivered. He was a master at tormenting others. A demon in human form.</p>",
    "<p>Desir clapped his hands. \u201cWell, that\u2019s just the way it is. Our job right now is simple: keep sniping every party to tell them our location. Tell them their enemies are right here, in this clock tower.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica moved to the window. She spoke as she cast her detection magic silently. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll come even if I keep shooting them like this.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat other choice do they have? This place is the quest objective.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>After all, everyone had to come to Privius Clock Tower to clear the quest. Desir\u2019s party was simply reminding them of that fact, with bullets instead of words.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNow, let the mud fight begin.\u201d Desir clapped.</p>",
    "<p>The sound of a bullet was lost in the wind.</p>"
