    "<p>It was May, and the sun-kissed showers of Spring were fading. It was almost time for the songs of love.</p>",
    "<p>Small flowers kissed the entrance of Hebrion Academy, branching out from trees that contained limitless vitality inside. This was an annual tradition of Hebrion Academy. Romantica\u2019s eyes sparkled at the sight of the breathtaking greenery lining their school. She had a spring in her step as she danced through the corridor. \u201cBuckthorn trees.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe flowers of the buckthorn tree symbolize progress,\u201d added Pram. It was unusual of him to comment.</p>",
    "<p>This was a historical tradition originating from the school\u2019s founding principal, Eiricquel Hebrion. It was a prayer for the growth of Hebrion Academy and its students. Today, the students rarely cared about the founding principal\u2019s wishes\u2014they were just here to enjoy the scenery. As the pair strolled under the trees, they lost track of time, awed by the gorgeous landscape around them. Eventually, the sound of falling raindrops rang across the leaves. \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s about to rain,\u201d said Pram.</p>",
    "<p>***</p>",
    "<p>Rain began to pour down from the overcast sky. It rained all across Hebrion Academy and the skies became murky. Romantica paused and pursed her lips. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get my clothes wet,\u201d complained Romantica as the rain rode down the hem of her string-spun clothes. The rain flowed between the grooves in the strings like a river. The downpour quickly drenched the uniforms of Romantica and Pram. Despite that, they didn\u2019t mind one bit.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt rained like this back in the Shadow World, right?\u201d reminisced Romantica.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt was colder and more unpleasant back then.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The two of them knowingly smiled at each other and covered up with their jackets. \u201cThe rain hasn\u2019t changed\u2014it\u2019s just that our situation\u2019s different.\u201d Romantica took the lead as the two of them travelled to Starling dormitory, home of their fearless leader.</p>",
    "<p>As they walked into the lobby, Romantica took the initiative to dry herself with magic. The Starling dormitory lobby was almost empty, likely due to the rain. Desir Arman sat in the center of the lobby, waiting for them to arrive. He wasn\u2019t alone.</p>",
    "<p>Sitting across from him was a beautiful girl with platinum blonde hair. Strands of gold woven with silver\u2014the color of the southern lions. The mere sight of it made her peers sing praises of her name. The silver-haired spellsword, Ajest Zedga F. Kingscrown. There were in middle of a heated conversation.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt was already past 2 o\u2019clock by then. It was past the time for the 2 o\u2019clock demon to appear. The gears of the clock tower should have stopped by then,\u201d explained Desir. \u201cMy hijacking only works on spells cast through a formula. The demon summoning device in Privius Clock Tower appears to have been built on an advanced magic formula. It was only because of this that it was possible to hijack it.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI see. I do recall the sound of the gears stopping at some point. I hadn\u2019t realized that.\u201d The hint was there\u2014she merely didn\u2019t put it to good use. She was deep in thought as she collected her thoughts.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDrawing me into close combat wasn\u2019t a bad choice, but you should always keep the battlefield in mind. We were in a Shadow World\u2014not taking the objectives into account was your downfall.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest\u2019s shoulders slumped as she took it all in. She had been goaded into her every move. \u201cSo you always had your eyes set on the big picture, instead of only focusing on our fight,\u201d said Ajest bluntly.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWell, maybe you\u2019re right.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest grew quiet, and reflected over the course of events that took place in the Shadow World. She closed her eyes, and organized her thoughts and said three simple words to Desir. \u201cI lost. Decisively.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir waved his hand and dismissed Ajest\u2019s thoughts. \u201cYou\u2019re going too far. I can brag, but there was luck involved. If my analysis was a bit slower, or your blade a bit faster\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThen we would have avenged Mr. Desir,\u201d said Pram. The pair interrupted the conversation and separated the two of them. \u201cBy that point, we\u2019d essentially won our part of the battle,\u201d added Romantica.</p>",
    "<p>Desir grinned at the arrival of his party members. \u201cYou guys came.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The group of four crowded around a table and sat down. Romantica looked moody as she glanced at Ajest and spoke directly to Desir. \u201cWeren\u2019t we the only ones meeting you here?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAjest\u2019s only here for a moment. She had a few questions about our fight.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEven so, she\u2019s an enemy\u2014right? We almost lost because of her. Don\u2019t you think you\u2019re be a little too calm?\u201d Romantica\u2019s eyes darted from Desir to Ajest.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf that was all it took for you to lose, then you weren\u2019t even worthy of entering Alpha class,\u201d said Ajest.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica\u2019s eyed flared. \u201cWhat?!\u201d The regal Ajest gave Romantica a casual glance and said no more. Catching a whiff of the arising conflict, Desir hurriedly added some choice words to the conversation. \u201cAjest is just trying to say that we deserved it, seeing as how we passed the exam and have been promoted to the Alpha class.\u201d He scratched his head and gave Romantica a slight smile.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat\u2014that\u2019s what that meant?\u201d Romantica crossed her arms, putting on airs. \u201cWell\u2026 I supposed if you\u2019re going so far to say something like that, then so be it.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHonestly, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to win without Romantica\u2019s sniping. Thanks, Romantica.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWha? Thanks? Mm\u2026 well, you didn\u2019t need to thank me or anything\u2026\u201d Romantica turned beet red and started twiddling her fingers in embarrassment at Desir\u2019s thanks.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAnd me? Mr. Desir, what about me?\u201d Pram\u2019s eyes gleamed in anticipation. \u201cYou did well too, Pram.\u201d Desir patted Pram\u2019s head as the latter hugged Desir\u2019s waist. Pram clung to Desir like a puppy and pushed his head into Desir\u2019s palm.</p>",
    "<p>Ajest watched the scene unfold from behind them. \u201cThis means we\u2019re taking a break from training now\u2026right?\u201d Romantica looked apprehensive as she looked over to see Desir\u2019s response.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOn whose authority? Training happens every day,\u201d said Desir with a stern appearance.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat? No! We barely got out of the promotion battle yesterday! This is too much!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDid you forget exactly what won us the promotion battle yesterday?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEven so\u2026 tch!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The conversation turned into a noisy ruckus as Romantica and Desir bantered back and forth. Seeing the break in conversation, Ajest stood up from the table and announced her leave. Pram tried to cover up his laughter at the scene of his fellow party members, before seeing Ajest. \u201cHm? You\u2019re leaving already?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest took a good look at the rest of the group, before wordlessly holding up her Identity Pass. Blue Moon Party\u2019s insignia displayed on the display. A party summons. They couldn\u2019t make her stay any longer. As she started walking to the door, she paused before turning around and looked at Desir. She seemed hesitant, a far cry from the ice queen they normally associated with her. \u201cDesir, I have a\u2026 a request.\u201d Her eyes looked intently at Desir, as if searching for the answer without need to ask her question. \u201cI know this is shameless, but may I join your training sessions?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica and Pram stood stunned at the request. Desir nodded cheerfully at Ajest. \u201cEvery morning at 6 o\u2019clock sharp, and after class. We meet at the Training Sector\u2019s entrance.\u201d The door creaked open and the sound of rain poured into the lobby. Ajest opened her mouth slightly, then closed it again. A whisper of a smile showed up on her face as she turned back around, and stepped out of Starling dormitory. The door closed, and the sound of rain died down.</p>",
    "<p>Thank you.</p>",
    "<p>***</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo what are we going to do now, Mr. Desir?\u201d Pram asked. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve been promoted to Alpha Class, are we done with the pa\u2014\u201c</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Desir was resolute. \u201cThe discrimination against the Beta Class still exists. We\u2019re going to create a path for all of the talent in Beta Class.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat a wonderful plan!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat a pain in the neck\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The responses from his fellow party members were very different. Desir teased \u201cThen, Miss Romantica, are you leaving the party?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWh-wha? Who\u2019s leaving? I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s a hassle! Obviously I\u2019m going to help!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf it\u2019s ever too much, you can always quit. Hehe,\u201d said Pram.</p>",
    "<p>Desir sat back down and leaned into his chair, watching the two of them argue.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018I shouldn\u2019t forget my real objective.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>He needed to handle the looming threat of the Shadow Labyrinth. Entering the Alpha Class was the first step. After gathering more party members and helping them grow, they would methodically clear away the Shadow Worlds, reducing casualties as much as possible. When the true threat known as the Shadow Labyrinth appeared, the party he trained would become the key to clearing it. As Desir became embroiled in his thoughts, he heard a familiar voice chime in.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI see you\u2019re all here.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Professor Brigitte stepped into the lobby and sat down in front of the three students. She surveyed the members with a mild expression.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI have some very important news for everyone here.\u201d Brigitte raised her finger, and waves of mana exuded from her body. A chocolate cake appeared from thin air and landed on the table. It was a huge cake\u2014large enough to cover the whole table. The decorations adorning the cake were exquisite. Romantica did her best not to drool all over the table. She recognized the cake immediately.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBeswald Bakery\u2019s specialty cake!?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Beswald Bakery is a famous bakery whose prices made your eyes pop out of their sockets. Only then did Desir and Pram catch on. \u201cIsn\u2019t this a bit much?\u201d asked Desir.</p>",
    "<p>The professor laughed joyfully at Desir\u2019s question. \u201cNot at all. Seeing that pig-headed noble so humiliated is well worth it.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cPig-headed?\u201d Desir inquired about exactly who Brigitte was referring to, when she pulled him into a tight hug. Her arms were trembling and her cheeks flush with excitement. Desir was shocked by the current state of events and he tried to reel back in confusion. \u201cProfessor?!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWh-what are you doing!\u201d Romantica blurted out.</p>",
    "<p>In quick succession, Pram also whined. \u201cWait your turn!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Despite the protest of Pram and Romantica, Brigitte hugged Desir even more tightly. \u201cWell done. You\u2019ve done it.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>She held up three Alpha Class badges, and the three youths were ecstatic. They jumped in the air and were wild with joy.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cCongratulations. You have been formalized as Single Rankers of the 217th class.\u201d</p>"
