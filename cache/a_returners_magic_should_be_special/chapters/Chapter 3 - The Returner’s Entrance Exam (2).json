    "<p>Desir had given a flawless explanation\u2014his description sounded like it was straight from a textbook.\r</p>",
    "<p>Not to be outdone, Radoria held up two fingers. \u201cThere are two organizations that manage the Shadow World. The first is the Western Kingdom, and the second is our Hebrion Academy. The two are at odds\u2014after all, both parties want the magic cores that come from the Shadow World. And, as students of Hebrion Academy, we naturally participate in the two-party race for magic cores... well, there are other factions, like the \u201coutsiders,\u201d but you don\u2019t need to know about that.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Radoria continued, \u201cAnd you know about \u2018clearing\u2019 the Shadow World, right?\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOf course\u2014that\u2019s common knowledge.\u201d To Desir, describing the Shadow World was second nature, and so he went on to explain:\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIn a sense, the Shadow World was a universe that ran parallel to our own\u2014the events that occured in the real world\u2019s past would also eventually occur in the Shadow World. And during that process, the Shadow World would continually threaten to erode our world. There is only one way to stop that from happening:\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe \u2018Clearing.\u2019\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cTo put it simply, \u2018clearing\u2019 the Shadow World prevents it from encroaching upon our reality. If the event of a given Shadow World is based off of a past war in our world\u2014the \u2018background\u2019\u2014and the victory of that war consisted in demoralizing the enemy, then the \u2018clearing\u2019 would involve defeating the enemy in the exact same manner\u2014this would be the Shadow World\u2019s \u2018objective.\u2019 Every Shadow World has its own background and objective, and completing that objective \u2018clears\u2019 the Shadow World.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe goal, then, is to clear all the Shadow Worlds that appear. And the two rival organizations, Western Kingdoms and Hebrion Academy, stand at the forefront of this movement.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Radoria wore an amused expression, \u201cNot bad. I guess I don\u2019t have to worry about explaining things to you.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>As the pair talked, they arrived at their destination: an extravagant, awe- inducing structure shining under the sunlight, the main building of Hebrion Academy. Radoria flashed her ID at the entrance.\r</p>",
    "<p>| Student Identity Pass Confirmed. Welcome, 4th Circle Mage, Radoria Von Dorich.\r</p>",
    "<p>With an electronic voice, the door opened, and the pair stepped into the main building. They were greeted by a grand hall\u2014the building\u2019s enormous interior was just as splendid as its exterior. Countless students and faculty walked in and out of the innumerable corridors in the main hall, electrifying the atmosphere. Desir looked around the area, nostalgia gripping him.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look that surprised.\u201d Radoria had expected more of a reaction out of Desir, so his nonchalant attitude sparked her curiosity.\r</p>",
    "<p>With a somewhat dismissive tone, Desir said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve seen something similar in the past.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>More accurately, he had seen this exact building.\r</p>",
    "<p>The pair began making their way up a winding staircase. Though the complicated layout of the corridors almost resembled a maze, Radoria confidently led the two through the various hallways. While following his companion, Desir passed by a number of people, most of whom he recognized. Their familiar faces warmed Desir\u2019s heart, but he concealed his emotions and quietly walked behind Radoria.\r</p>",
    "<p>Suddenly, a tall, handsome man and a girl who looked about the same age as Desir approached the pair. When Radoria saw them, she halted in her tracks.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDo you know them?\u201d Desir asked.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYeah. Elheim. He\u2019s a real scumbag.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Desir remembered that name. Elheim. He was the polar opposite of Radoria. Elheim was a water-attribute mage, and Radoria was a fire-attribute mage. And like their magical elements, their personalities clashed violently. Obviously, they did not get along.\r</p>",
    "<p>Feigning ignorance, Desir commented, \u201cYou must really dislike that man.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOh, yeah. He\u2019s one of those water-attribute mages,\u201d Radoria said. \u201cHe\u2019s real arrogant, too. And I hate the way he speaks. He\u2019s like a damn cockroach.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>After Desir and Radoria\u2019s brief exchange, Elheim\u2014a young man with blue, bobbed hair, with arrogant eyes and a stuck-up nose\u2014walked up to Radoria. His voice laced with derision, Elheim commented, \u201cOi, Radoria. You just got here? I guess having short legs makes you walk slower, huh?\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Without losing her composure, the young fire-attribute mage retorted, \u201cGrow up, Elheim. Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Elheim scoffed in response, \u201cSuch crude speech. As expected of a crude fire- attribute mage.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you have the balls to mouth off less than a month after getting trounced by this \u2018crude fire-attribute mage.\u2019\u201d Radoria jeered.\r</p>",
    "<p>Elheim rolled his eyes. \u201cYou still can\u2019t tell the difference between defeating someone, and them going easy on you? No wonder you have such a long way to go.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Radoria sneered. \u201cI sure hope you weren\u2019t trying\u2014if that was all you got, then you really should consider dropping out.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>The tension in the air was potent. Desir could almost feel the sparks flying between the two bantering mages\u2014he unconsciously took a step back. As Radoria and Elheim got more and more in each other\u2019s faces, the mood gradually turned heavier and more strained.\r</p>",
    "<p>Finally, realizing that he wouldn\u2019t win just through a contest of words, Elheim shifted his attention to Desir. \u201cAre you this vulgar girl\u2019s mentee?\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes, that is correct.\u201d Desir answered respectfully.\r</p>",
    "<p>Surprised, Elheim said, \u201cWell, you certainly have better manners than Radoria. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDesir Arman.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHmm, Desir Arman. Let\u2019s see\u2026\u201d Elheim took out his tablet and entered Desir\u2019s name.\r</p>",
    "<p>In just a few seconds, all of Desir\u2019s information appeared on the screen. As Elheim read the data, the corners of his mouth rising ever so slightly.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this? He\u2019s just a commoner?\u201d Elheim smirked. \u201cWell, I guess it fits that you\u2019re mentoring a pathetic commoner.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Radoria scrunched her face.\r</p>",
    "<p>Elheim looked up to the ceiling with amusement. \u201cHonestly. This contest won\u2019t even be close.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201c...Contest? What do you mean, \u2018contest?\u2019\u201d Radoria asked.\r</p>",
    "<p>As if he had waited for the question, Elheim responded, \u201cWhat? Did you not even check the group lists?\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>He indifferently flipped his tablet toward Radoria. \u201cWe\u2019re in the same group.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Desir and Radoria quickly read through the list of names:\r</p>",
    "<p>[D Group Members]\r</p>",
    "<p>Treveurie Tigus\r</p>",
    "<p>Romantica Eru\r</p>",
    "<p>Ajest Kingscrown\r</p>",
    "<p>Desir Arman\r</p>",
    "<p>Elheim stared at Desir with a condescending gaze\u2014it was like he was looking at a rotten fish. \u201cThere\u2019s no way your mentee will survive with this lineup.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Radoria spoke up, seemingly unperturbed. \u201cI wonder about that. Even if you\u2019re in our group, that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019ll fail. In fact, we just might win.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh. You don\u2019t even have a chance.\u201d Then Elheim raised his voice, and declared with confidence: \u201cMY mentee is a spellsword.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Radoria\u2019s eyes widened in shock. \u201cS-spellsword? You\u2019re lying.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Spellsword.\r</p>",
    "<p>Those who were innately talented in both magic and swordsmanship. This title was reserved for geniuses blessed by the heavens. They were on a whole different level than the mages who simply used magic\u2014it didn\u2019t matter if combat occured at close or long-range. These specialists could fight on all fronts. And as to be expected, these exceptional talents only numbered in the single digits worldwide.\r</p>",
    "<p>And Elheim just said that his mentee was one of those single digits\u2014an unrivalled genius. Radoria could not believe it.\r</p>",
    "<p>With a conceited facial expression, Elheim taunted his stunned rival. \u201cYou can check it if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>After a brief moment of hesitation, Radoria took out her tablet. She addressed Elheim\u2019s mentee who had remained silent the entire time, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAjest Kingscrown.\u201d The girl spoke with a dour and ice-cold voice.\r</p>",
    "<p>Radoria entered the name into the tablet. When the information popped up, Radoria quickly scanned the results.\r</p>",
    "<p>| Twin-attribute spellsword. Shows excellent talent with both ice\u2014and lightning\u2014attribute magic. 3rd circle mage. Swordsmanship exceeds the level of a pawn-rank swordsman.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMy god\u2026\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Radoria\u2019s jaw dropped. She thought Elheim had been bluffing\u2014but here was the truth right in front of her eyes.\r</p>",
    "<p>With smug assurance, Elheim piped up, \u201cWhere did that fire from earlier go, Radoria?\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Radoria, for once, was at a loss for words.\r</p>",
    "<p>The victorious water-attribute mage strolled past the dumbfounded woman. When he reached Desir, Elheim stopped for a brief moment.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOh, and you. This is a warning.\u201d He leaned in close to Desir\u2019s face, glaring at the young man with an attitude of pompous superiority. It was a perfect example of a noble looking down upon a commoner. \u201cEven if you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll just end up in Beta. Just give up on the entrance exams\u2014that\u2019s your best bet.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>| The D Group\u2019s Entrance Exam will soon begin! D Group\u2019s Shadow World is currently being selected. Please wait.\r</p>",
    "<p>An electronic voice rang out. Desir stood in the middle of the waiting room\u2014a Shadow Gate, boasting one of the most advanced designs, loomed in front of him. The steel outline of the gate was inscribed with hundreds of runes. With a magic core in its center, thousands of synthesized magic circles decorated the face of the gate. It could almost pass as a work of art.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Is this what it looked like?\u2019 Desir leaned left and right while inspecting the gate.\r</p>",
    "<p>An annoyed voice spoke to him, \u201cCould you just stand still? You\u2019re embarrassing us.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Desir turned towards the voice. There were three other students with him, all of whom would also be taking the test. Two of them were giving off an unmistakable air of hostility toward Desir\u2014Ajest, on the other hand, was silently cleaning her sword.\r</p>",
    "<p>The girl who had lectured Desir was named Romantica. She didn\u2019t know Desir at all\u2014but Desir knew all about her.\r</p>",
    "<p>Romantica Eru.\r</p>",
    "<p>She had been a 4th circle wind-attribute mage, known for defeating her enemies with her specialty: chantless magic. Hers was one of the more brilliant minds among all wind-attribute mages. With her talent, she could have risen much higher\u2014had she not died an untimely death.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u2018But as of right now, she\u2019s a 2nd circle, right?\u2019 Not wanting to antagonize the competitors so early on, Desir decided to just apologize graciously, \u201cSorry, guys. It\u2019s my first time seeing something amazing like this.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Romantica had hoped to get a rise out of Desir, but when he didn\u2019t react the way she had hoped, she just sighed and said, \u201cNow that I think about it, they did say there was a commoner hick in our group.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat? We\u2019re going to test with someone like that?\u201d The swordsman, Treveurie Tigus, stared at Desir with disgust.\r</p>",
    "<p>But Desir had already stopped paying attention to them.</p>"
