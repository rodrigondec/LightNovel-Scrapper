    "<p>Desir continued. \u201cEven though we can manipulate it in various ways, we can\u2019t change the fundamental properties of the Shadow World, such as its historical events or the clear objective. That\u2019s why we have to study history.\u201d This was why the study of history in this world was so abnormally advanced, to the extent where there were specialized teams of historians dedicated only to studying the Shadow Worlds.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is\u2026\u201d said Romantica, \u201cthese books are references for the Shadow World of the promotion battle?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d answered Desir.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica glared at the disgustingly large pile of paper before her. She didn\u2019t know if she would be able to get through it all even if she pulled three back-to- back all-nighters. \u201cYou\u2019re certain that this is relevant to our promotion battle?\u201d Romantica\u2019s question was blunt, to the point.</p>",
    "<p>Desir responded calmly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir spoke sternly. \u201cNo objections, Romantica.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cUgh.\u201d Romantica threw her hands in the air in protest, but there was no way Desir would change his mind.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThese are the historical events that I feel are most likely to appear in the exam. If you don\u2019t agree with my methods, you can instead try reading every history book in this library.\u201d It was a joke, but for Romantica it was no different than a threat. Desir watched sympathetically as Romantica cringed and shuddered.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018I didn\u2019t want to be this harsh, but\u2026\u2019 Desir sighed. He had no other choice. After all, he couldn\u2019t exactly tell them that he came from the future and knew exactly which Shadow World would appear. Desir ordered them to get started. \u201cRead all the history books I picked out and write a short essay summarizing their events.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAaaaargh!\u201d Romantica slumped back on her chair, unable to prevent the cry of agony from escaping her lips.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica closed her eyes and whimpered. Then she focused, gathering unpleasant memories together and releasing it all with a breath. Desir was truly exceptional at tormenting people. This was no different than torture.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat guy is definitely a sadist,\u201d she muttered.</p>",
    "<p>Pram turned a page. He looked up from his book, which was already read halfway. \u201cHe\u2019s doing this to help us.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWell, duh,\u201d retorted Romantica. It was the fact that Desir was doing this for them that was annoying her. It made her not want to defy him. When she was with him, Romantica forgot that she was a noble, even though that was was the reason she had decided to stay with the team originally.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica leafed through a book, but couldn\u2019t process anything she read. It was impossible for her to study in this situation. She closed the book and looked around. Desir was focusing intensely on his book.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica leaned over and whispered softly so that Desir couldn\u2019t hear. \u201cPram.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes?\u201d, he whispered back.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI can\u2019t help but notice that you\u2019ve been a bit more attached to Desir recently.\u201d Her voice sounded slightly accusatory.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHuh? What are you talking about?\u201d Pram looked at her quizzically.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica narrowed her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s weird, that\u2019s all. You two look so friendly now. Did you go and hang out without me?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram tried to avoid the subject. \u201cAh, who knows? It wasn\u2019t really hanging out\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhere did you go without me? Wait, are you wearing different clothes? Did you two go out on a date or something?\u201d teased Romantica.</p>",
    "<p>Pram flinched and turned to focus on his book. \u201cHmm, so this happened in 1417. I should remember this.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t ignore me. I\u2019m on to you.\u201d Romantica\u2019s tone was light as she playfully reached over to tickle Pram.</p>",
    "<p>Pram desperately tried not to make a sound, covering his mouth with hand while trying to wriggle out of the way. As they messed around, Pram\u2019s elbow accidentally bumped the desk and a precariously placed book fell on the floor loudly.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cStop playing around and start studying.\u201d Desir was stern as he spoke to his party members.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSorry, Mr. Desir.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSorry~\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica bent down to pick up the book, but an elegant looking hand got to it first. As her eyes looked up, she traced the hand back to its owner. Once she saw who it was, she gasped in shock. Standing before her was a goddess of beauty with eyes cold enough to shatter ice. Her platinum blonde hair swayed gracefully by her waist.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAjest\u2026 Kingscrown.\u201d Romantica\u2019s eyes immediately fell upon the Blue Moon crest on Ajest\u2019s chest. The Blue Moon party. Their enemies.</p>",
    "<p>As Ajest looked around the room, Romantica spoke coldly. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest did not react to her at all. As if to say \u2018I have no interest in you,\u2019 she walked brusquely past Romantica and sat across the table from Desir. It was as if the only thing she was interested in was Desir Arman.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d She said, emotionless as always.</p>",
    "<p>Desir answered her with his usual lackadaisical tone. \u201cSo it has.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>This was true-as the two had not met again since the entrance exam, this was their first encounter in two months. Two months. For some, this was a long time, whilst for others it was short. Regardless, it was long enough to decide one\u2019s affiliation.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe Blue Moon party. You chose well. It\u2019s very fitting for you.\u201d complimented Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s fitting?\u201d Ajest responded with doubt.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat you and the party both stand at the top.\u201d Desir had nothing but praise for Ajest.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNot anymore, unfortunately.\u201d Ajest paused for a moment before elaborating, \u201cAfter all, you\u2019re here, Desir Arman.\u201d Desir put his book down and rested his chin on his hand. Ajest\u2019s implication was clear: You brought me down.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI heard you passed the tournament.\u201d Her voice contained a tinge of excitement, something unusual for Ajest.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe did. We were lucky,\u201d said Desir.</p>",
    "<p>Ajest was dissatisfied with his answer. \u201cYou can hardly say that you were lucky when your specialty is analysis. Well, no matter.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>By passing the tournament, Desir\u2019s party moved into the top 30 of Hebrion Academy, which meant that they had earned the right to participate in the promotion battle.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo when we next meet\u2026\u201d Desir\u2019s question was abruptly cut short by Ajest. \u201cIt will be on the battlefield. In the Shadow World.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir followed Ajest\u2019s train of thought. He was certain what was coming next. There was only one reason for Ajest to visit them. \u201cHave you come to declare war?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest was silent, as if she was at a loss for words after having her intent clearly read. \u201cThat\u2019s your personality right? Paying respects to your opponents and declaring war before the battle?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest met Desir\u2019s eyes. The two stared at each other intensely, trying to fathom each other\u2019s thoughts.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve recognized me as your rival,\u201d Desir stated. He was confident this was the case.</p>",
    "<p>Desir got her, but Ajest couldn\u2019t read anything from Desir\u2019s eyes. It had been like that from the start. His smiling face was so strangely serene, without a hint of uncertainty. Reading his thoughts was impossible. It was the expression of an experienced politician.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou know me too well, Desir Arman,\u201d Ajest relented. \u201cIt is as you say. I think of you as my rival.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s an honor.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cTo disregard you before was my error. A misjudgment. I apologize for that,\u201d Ajest bowed her head, her voice steeled with resolve. As she looked back up, her bright platinum blonde hair swayed. She was truly beautiful enough to make one speechless. Her elegant, delicate appearance was more becoming of a charming princess than a battleworn knight.</p>",
    "<p>But she was indeed a knight, and a flawless one at that. From her perpetually restrained attitude and speech to her abnormally incredible talent.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cStill, I have no intention of losing to you. I\u2019ll use all my strength to defeat you. That is all.\u201d A slight tremor in her voice betrayed her competitive spirit. Her drive to win against others, to rise up while breaking her enemies apart. That was the driving force behind her growth, her strength.</p>",
    "<p>Acknowledging her feelings, Desir secretly felt happy. \u2018Things are going according to plan.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>He had been planning it from the start. In the entrance exam, he\u2019d revealed much more of his strength than necessary. He had defeated Ajest Kingscrown, the clear favorite, in an overwhelming fashion. He could say that he\u2019d done it in</p>",
    "<p>an attempt to enter the Alpha Class, but Desir had already known that, as a commoner, he would be assigned to the Beta Class.</p>",
    "<p>No-the main reason was Ajest Kingscrown. By defeating her, his plan was to make himself her target. The mighty spellsword. The woman standing at the top in the Shadow Labyrinth. Desir would gladly become her rival if it meant that she would become stronger. No, she absolutely had to. \u2018Because you\u2019re the key to clearing the Shadow Labyrinth.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Desir\u2019s eyes were looking far into the future, as always. Looking at the big picture. This woman was the shining ray of hope in Desir\u2019s plans. \u201cI look forward to an honorable duel, Ajest Kingscrown.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The cheers were so loud that they could have blown apart the main building of Hebrion Academy. There was a magic-strengthened metal frame supporting a gigantic panel that covered the ceiling. The panel shone down on the main building, over 10,000 spectators, around 200 professors and supervisors, and the 30 participants of the promotion battle.</p>",
    "<p>Spectator seating wrapped around the Shadow Gate like a coliseum. The interior of the building was no different than an arena. This was intentional, as the interior was recently remodelled to resemble an arena for this special day.</p>",
    "<p>Many kinds of people gathered in the audience. Aside from the expected students and professors, there were many visitors from all over the world. Ticket prices were expensive, but just the name of Hebrion Academy\u2019s promotion battle was enough to sell out the seats.</p>",
    "<p>It was a highly entertaining spectacle after all. In the safety of the modified Shadow World, boys and girls would kill and be killed in order to move up in the ranks. Additionally, these were the top students of Hebrion Academy. They would surely display skills worthy of the greatest school in the world. Spectators were looking forward to a high-level battle. The promotion battle was one of the biggest money makers for Hebrion Academy.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cLet\u2019s go over our roles,\u201d Desir turned to Romantica first, \u201cRomantica, you\u2019re our sniper. Use detection magic from long range and take out enemies one by one.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not sure if sniping will work on Alpha Class students,\u201d she answered nervously.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. That\u2019s why we practiced, right?\u201d Desir gave her clear instructions and helped her calm down. \u201cTake as long as you need when using detection magic, but as soon as you locate an enemy, immediately cast your sniping magic. Even if they\u2019re Alpha Class, they\u2019ll go down if they can\u2019t react fast enough.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOkay, but I still have a problem.\u201d Romantica said. \u201cThis is my first time using long-range sniping magic. I don\u2019t know how much power to use.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir smiled, he had already expected her to get cold feet. \u201cRemember the ball you practiced with? It was about as tough as a person\u2019s head.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica\u2019s eyes widened. She had spent countless hours getting accustomed to the level of power required to destroy those balls with her ranged attacks. \u201cAh, so that\u2019s why\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir already had this in mind. He\u2019d been set on her role from the beginning.</p>"
