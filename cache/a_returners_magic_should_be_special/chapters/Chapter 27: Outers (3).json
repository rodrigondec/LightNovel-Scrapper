    "<p>Brigitte pulled her chair forward and clenched her fist. \u201cIf this wasn\u2019t intentional\u2026 there\u2019s no way.\u201d The calm and collected Professor was nowhere to be found. Her voice was trembling with anger. \u201cOf course. The reason why he insisted on taking charge of the Tower of Magic sponsorship. I thought something was fishy, but this is just despicable! To think he\u2019d be this cheap!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>In truth, Desir hadn\u2019t expected Professor Nifleka to go to such means. For a professor to blatantly show such bias was unthinkable. \u2018Was it because I defeated his Blue Moon Party?\u2019 Desir couldn\u2019t determine why the professor would go to such lengths. In any case, the buffoon\u2019s motives didn\u2019t matter. What did was the current situation\u2014the deadline had passed. There was no point in complaining.</p>",
    "<p>Seeing the look of loss on Desir\u2019s face, Brigitte immediately reassured him. \u201cI\u2019ll look for anything I can do to fix this. For now, go and rest.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir nodded at his teacher, and returned to his office. He didn\u2019t have much hope that her intervention would solve the situation.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018On top of all that, the Tower of Magic has a very rigid schedule.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>As Desir traipsed back to his papers, he came to the conclusion why Nifleka acted so brashly. At the realization, Desir felt an uncharacteristic anger boiling up inside of him. He laughed bitterly. \u2018So you\u2019ve decided to act first.\u2019 His eyes gleamed as he hatched a plan. \u2018Two can play that game.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Now seated in front of his mountain of paper again, he flipped open the piece of paper in his pocket. It was the timeline of events he had written down prior. Skimming down the list, he traced his finger until he got to what he was looking for. A smile tugged at the corners of his mouth. \u2018I can be just as cheap.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>\u2026</p>",
    "<p>3 Points. Attack on Tower of Magic\u2019s Aeurelli Branch - July 7th</p>",
    "<p>\u2026</p>",
    "<p>It was a late summer night, and the air was brisk. A man with a handsome mustache dressed in neat clothes took long strides along the street engulfed by the night fog. His name was Criken. Criken was extremely tall, with a well-built frame. His eyes peered up into the night sky, before falling on a boy running toward him with a bag full of rye bread. His shabby appearance gave Criken more than enough information about this child. The hard rye bread in his arms was precious food for his family.</p>",
    "<p>Criken moved aside as the boy continued to run, but they still bumped shoulders. The bread bag flew into the air, and a look of panic showed on the boy\u2019s face. Suddenly, something strange happened\u2014the bag stopped in mid air, as if somebody were holding it. Criken grabbed the bag out of the air, and peered at the fallen boy.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSorry, sir.\u201d The boy\u2019s eyes were downtrodden at his mistake.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Are you hurt?\u201d Criken offered his outstretched hand to the boy and helped him up. After he stood back up, Criken wiped away the soot on the child\u2019s face. \u201cWhere are you headed?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m heading home to my family, sir.\u201d The boy gave a quiet smile to the man who helped him up.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWith this bread?\u201d Criken asked.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s for my little sister, sir. She isn\u2019t able to come out of the house,\u201d said the boy. His eyes looked earnestly up at the towering man in front of him.</p>",
    "<p>Criken\u2019s intuition was correct, and he nodded in understanding. \u201cDon\u2019t walk around outside so late. Your sister will worry.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The boy nodded his head fiercely. \u201cYes. Thank you, sir.\u201d He stared at the bag of bread in Criken\u2019s hands.</p>",
    "<p>As Criken moved the bag to and fro, the boy\u2019s eyes were mesmerized by it. He smirked. \u201cRight. I should give this back.\u201d Criken held out the bag to the boy.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThank you, sir!\u201d the boy exclaimed. Just as the boy\u2019s hands touched the bag, Criken suddenly turned it upside down and emptied its contents onto the floor.</p>",
    "<p>In shock, the boy asked what he was doing. Criken responded by crushing the bread underneath his feet. They broke apart into crumbs and mixed into the dirt, completely inedible. A faint look of amusement appeared in Criken\u2019s eyes as he wandered past the bewildered boy. He was feeling quite cheerful\u2014whenever he was about to do something important, he would have a bit of fun with things like this.</p>",
    "<p>As the moonlight faded away and the darkness grew deeper, the street lights flickered and the shadows disappeared. He rounded a third corner until he could no longer see any lit street lights. Surrounded by pitch black darkness, he stopped in his tracks. In front of him laid a giant metal door embossed with the words Tower of Magic, Aeurelli Branch in an elegant cursive. At this point, he tossed his fedora aside, revealing a mask shaped like a shark with horns. In the dead of night, he said a single word.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAssemble.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Restless shadows stirred from the seedy underbelly of the city, and 80 silhouettes stood behind him. Each of them wore masks adorned with skulls and dark black cloaks, merging with the darkness. The masquerade began channeling all manners of spells. Waves of mana rippled through the air as a menagerie of spells clashed with the gate. A powerful magic barrier activated, nullifying the slew of magic that struck the metal gate.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018As expected of the Tower of Magic.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Criken gestured forward with his chin, and a number of heavy-set men stepped forward to pound and grind down the gate. The door began to yield in reaction to the overwhelming force. \u201cKeep going,\u201d said Criken. \u201cWe can\u2019t let it adapt.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Additional clangs rang out from the door, as the enchantment weakened. As the mana could only flow in one direction, it could only activate one spell at a time. The enchantment could only augment its physical or magical durability\u2014even with the greatest source of mana in the world, it wouldn\u2019t matter. Criken smirked as the door opened with a boom.</p>",
    "<p>An ear-splitting alarm rang out\u2014the intruders entered the Tower of Magic. Security guards and mages poured out from the Tower of Magic and formed ranks, with the defensive towers manned and sights readied on the incoming masked foes. Criken was taken aback at their quick response time, but that didn\u2019t deter him. He signaled his subordinates to charge.</p>",
    "<p>The masked marauders let out a war cry as they engaged the incoming forces. Sounds of steel clashing, roars of triumph, and explosions echoed throughout the battlefield. In the chaos, Criken quietly left the battlefield, with 6 of his subordinates in tow.</p>",
    "<p>[Invisibility.]</p>",
    "<p>The high-level spell refracted light to make one disappear from sight. They tore away from the fight as the security guards continued to flood onto the war zone. \u201cThey really came!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Criken and his men skirted off to one side. He glanced at the guards as they went down the stairs, and then smiled to himself. Everything was perfect. With the Tower of Magic\u2019s forces gathered on the lower floors, they wouldn\u2019t be able to prevent him from accomplishing his goal. The only thing which bothered him was how quickly they reacted. \u2018No matter. Everything is according to plan.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>The 80 men were merely a distraction. The main forces had dispersed from the upper floors, and he leisurely walked up the stairs.</p>",
    "<p>Tower of Magic\u201420th Floor.</p>",
    "<p>Compared to the floors below, the 20th floor was rather small. As he entered the top floor, his eyes were drawn toward a safe. Criken, wary of additional traps, conjured a magic formula in front of him as he took careful steps toward his prize.</p>",
    "<p>[Earth Rage.]</p>",
    "<p>3rd circle attack spell. The barriers layered on top of the safe were expelled by the tide of mana exerted by Criken. The safe was laid waste to and inside, a strange object illuminated the surrounding area. 2nd tier magic crystal\u2014Ruigenell\u2019s Tear. The brilliant blue light danced across Criken\u2019s palm, and the crystalline object pulsed like a beating heart. His eyes shined with greed and he reached out to grab the magic crystal\u2014</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d A young boy\u2019s voice rang out.</p>",
    "<p>Startled, Criken turned around. It was an incredibly beautiful boy\u2014no. He was so beautiful that it was difficult to tell if it was a boy or a girl. His voice was firm. \u201cPlease surrender, Outer.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>This was outside of expectations. \u201cYou were hiding forces in reserve? Interesting.\u201d Criken\u2019s voice wavered as he tried to determine how they figured his plan out. \u201cThis means that you had to have known our plans, our identity, and even our objective\u2026\u201d His voice trailed off. \u201cWho are you?\u201d His eyes narrowed as he tried to read his opponent.</p>",
    "<p>Pram Schneizer raised his sword with his eyes trained on his target, and said \u201cWith the authority of Hebrion\u2019s Single Ranker, I place you under arrest. You would do best to surrender.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI refuse.\u201d With that, Criken snapped his fingers and his companions lined up in front of him.</p>",
    "<p>[Elan\u2019s strength resides in me.]</p>",
    "<p>[Wave of Flame.]</p>",
    "<p>The mages created their constructs and aimed their sights at Pram. In response, Pram likewise used the time spent casting to analyze the enemy\u2019s strength.</p>",
    "<p>\u20184 mages, 2 swordsmen. Based on the spells being cast and the reactions of the swordsmen, these guys can\u2019t be much stronger than 2nd Circle and Pawn-rank.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>[Fireball.]</p>",
    "<p>[Ice Spear.]</p>",
    "<p>With the first two spells completed, the mages sent them careening toward the lone swordsman. A glint in Pram\u2019s eye shined as he swung his sword toward the incoming blasts of elemental energy. His Blanchume rapier bisected the Fireball and the Ice Spear left nary a scratch on Pram\u2019s head as they shattered into fragments of mana.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHe cut the magic?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAnti-magic sword!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Seeing the change in atmosphere, Pram leaped forward to subdue the mages. In response, the knights stood in an ironclad formation preventing Pram from making it to his quarry. The mages began casting a new salvo of spells with everybody back in position. The morale was high for the intruders, getting ready for Pram\u2019s execution, but\u2014</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s useless.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram disappeared in an instant. The swordsmen quickly frantically looked around, trying to find the blue-haired boy, only to discover he was already on top of their mages. This was the difference of rank: these Pawn-rank soldiers had no hope of matching up with the Knight-rank prodigy. A dull smack sounded and the first mage crumpled to the ground. Their expressions turned grave as Pram moved onto his next target. As he neared, a pulse rose from the ground and caught his foot.</p>",
    "<p>[Entangle]</p>",
    "<p>2nd circle snaring spell. Pram\u2019s battle senses were hardy, but he was in disbelief. \u2018No way. There weren\u2019t any mages casting spells\u2026\u2019</p>",
    "<p>He had missed it. There was a mage just outside of his vision, and now he would pay the price.</p>"
