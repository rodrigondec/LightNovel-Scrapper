    "<p>\u201cThe heart..?\u201d Zod mumbled to himself.\r</p>",
    "<p>Confused by his ramblings, someone asked, \u201cWhat do you mean by the heart?\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI read about it in a book many many years ago,\u201d Zod said. \u201cA dragon\u2019s heart acts like an engine for magic\u2014just like our mana circles. It\u2019s an enormous magic engine that sucks in the surrounding mana.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Mana circles. Mana was absorbed into mana circles so that it could be controlled and used. This was elementary knowledge for a mage.\r</p>",
    "<p>Zod continued, \u201cThe dragon\u2019s dead, which means there\u2019s nothing controlling the mana accumulated inside its heart now. Since mana is very fluid, it\u2019s continued to flow around, which has resulted in this \u2018engine\u2019 overheating. If this continues\u2014\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying!\u201d Priscilla interrupted. \u201cSay it in simpler terms!\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Desir spoke up, reaching the conclusion quickly. \u201cThe overheating engine is about to explode.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWHAAAT?!?!?\u201d Priscilla shrieked in a shrill voice.\r</p>",
    "<p>A terrible rumbling arose from the body, punctuating Desir\u2019s words. The uncontrollable mana overflowed, overwhelming everyone present, and causing their faces to turn deathly pale.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t we know about this before we killed it?\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Zod\u2019s usual empty eyes gleamed with despair. He spoke in a dead and\r</p>",
    "<p>monotonous voice, \u201c...Because...this is the first time humanity has ever defeated a dragon.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAn explosion caused by the pressure of the mana contained within the mana circle\u2026 This kind of phenomenon would be equivalent to 7th circle magic\u2026\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNo, even that\u2019s too low of an estimate. This amount of mana is beyond the reckoning of mortals. Also, if it\u2019s pure mana rather than magic, it\u2019s not something we can \u2018hijack.\u2019\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201c...I think it\u2019s time we prepared...\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>The looming inevitability cast a pall over the survivors, like a bitter, black cloud. It was as Zod said. A mana explosion of this scale was impossible to dodge, impossible to block.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI...I can\u2019t believe it. The world is really...right now\u2026\u201d Raphaello turned to face the gathering mana-storm with a thousand-yard stare.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOur Father who art in heaven...\u201d Priscilla\u2019s quiet prayer was drowned out by the coming storm.\r</p>",
    "<p>Desir stood at the center of the group, his face strained with pain and despair. The disaster unfolded before him, and a hundred thoughts raced through his mind. The magic surged outward, but only one thought stood out.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Is this the end?\u2019\r</p>",
    "<p>He closed his eyes, as he felt the wicked wind slash across his face.\r</p>",
    "<p>That was his final memory.\r</p>",
    "<p>Desir Arman opened his eyes, staring at his outstretched hand.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Wait.\u2019\r</p>",
    "<p>Something was amiss.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Where am I?\u2019\r</p>",
    "<p>Voices, chattering in excitement, filled the air. He lowered his hand and surveyed his surroundings. A massive chandelier, gilded with tens of sapphires, lit the room. Hundreds of students dressed in black uniforms sat at dozens of oak tables surrounding an antique stone shrine.\r</p>",
    "<p>As Desir glanced around in confusion, he realized, \u2018...this looks familiar...\u2019 Looking down, there was a glass cup in front of him. A young boy, eerily familiar, stared back in confusion. He had deep black eyes and bright red lips. His face wasn\u2019t quite handsome, but he had a bit of a childish charm to him.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Wait, this is...\u2019 Gone were the scar-covered cheeks and rugged skin. A fair, somewhat effeminate school-aged child greeted him. He was his adolescent self again.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u2018What\u2019s going on...? I definitely died back there...\u2019\r</p>",
    "<p>He sat, confusion and doubt racing through his mind, until a sudden ringing disrupted his thoughts.\r</p>",
    "<p>The ringing of a bell attracted everyone\u2019s attention back to the front. A beautiful young woman dressed in a professor\u2019s black uniform smiled as she ascended the stage. As the music ceased and chatter died down, the woman began speaking.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cPleased to meet you, applicants of Hebrion Academy. I am Professor Brigitte.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Desir stared at the woman intensely. It should have been the first time Desir was seeing her face, but instead, she seemed strangely familiar.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI know that many of you have come to Hebrion Academy from many different countries. I sincerely thank every one of you for having made this long journey to attend our school.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>She paused and drew a deep breath before continuing.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHowever, I regretfully inform you all that not everyone who has come here will be admitted to our academy. As is tradition, everyone will be required to take our entrance examination, the results of which will determine who is admitted. Only 600 of you will be admitted to Hebrion. We will be testing you, of course\u2014\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBy asking you to clear a Shadow World,\u201d Desir muttered under his breath as Professor Brigitte spoke.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201c--by asking you to clear a Shadow World,\u201d she said. \u201cDo not be nervous; while this examination is similar to a real Shadow World, this one is not real. This Shadow World has been specially constructed for the purposes of this exam. For more details, I ask that you ask your mentors when you meet them.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Brigitte looked at the students with a serious expression.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYear 3613, the 172nd entrance examination will begin in 2 hours in the main hall of the Academy. In the meantime, please enjoy the banquet we have prepared for you. I will see everyone again soon.\u201d Brigitte walked down from the platform as she finished her speech.\r</p>",
    "<p>The students collectively broke out in applause\u2014all except for Desir who looked down in disbelief.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Hebrion Academy entrance examination?\u2019\r</p>",
    "<p>Hebrion Academy was the top magic academy in the entire continent. Desir was an alumnus. He had graduated from Hebrion 10 years ago.\r</p>",
    "<p>Yet, now, somehow, he was again at the precipice of entering Hebrion Academy. His mind swirled with confusion. \u2018If it\u2019s 3613...\u2019\r</p>",
    "<p>Then he had been flung 13 years into the past. The Shadow Labyrinth had appeared in the year Lowellius 3616, and he had lived in the hellish nightmare for 10 years, from 3616 to 3626.\r</p>",
    "<p>Desir closed his eyes as felt the enormity of it all. Conflicting emotions raced through his heart: pangs of guilt pierced through the happiness he felt for coming back to this point.\r</p>",
    "<p>An eternity of suffering and torture. The blood of his friends who died and the tears he shed. All of it was for nothing. They failed to save the world.\r</p>",
    "<p>10 years of suffering and 150 million dead\u2014 all for nothing. It was unavoidable, undeniably a disaster.\r</p>",
    "<p>And yet, somehow...\r</p>",
    "<p>Desir Arman had returned 13 years into the past from that doomed future. It was like a joke\u2014a cruel, twisted joke.\r</p>",
    "<p>At first, Desir had simply thought that, perhaps, it had all been a dream; a particularly horrid nightmare that he had just awoken from. But the vivid memories were all too real. He couldn\u2019t have called it a dream, with all the desperate fights and the vast array of magic knowledge he had gained buried in his mind. All these memories flowing through his head were far too realistic for a dream.\r</p>",
    "<p>\"You're Desir Arman, aren't you?\"\r</p>",
    "<p>A young girl appeared in front of Desir, snapping him from his contemplation. She wore her red hair in a short bob, and, despite her short stature, her steely eyes gave off an aura of great confidence and will.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNice to meet you!\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019m Radoria Von Dorich, but you can call me Radoria. I\u2019m a second-year student of Hebrion Academy, and I\u2019ll be your mentor for the entrance examination today. I look forward to working with you!\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAh, please look after me.\u201d Even though his voice came out naturally, Desir felt an unnatural discomfort as he stared at Radoria.\r</p>",
    "<p>This was the same Radoria Von Dorich he had met in his past life. Radoria Von Dorich was a genius, a fire mage capable of 6th circle magic. She held the number 1 rank of her year for her entire time at Hebrion.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat are you thinking so much about?\u201d she asked.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m feeling pretty nervous,\u201d he answered.\r</p>",
    "<p>Radoria giggled. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to get scared over the entrance exam. The Shadow World they use is specially made; it\u2019s incomparable to a real Shadow World in difficulty.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s still an exam, though. Like, \u2018can you really go fight against the Shadow Worlds?\u2019 kinda thing.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Introductions more or less complete, Radoria started her preparations for the entrance exam. She flicked through her documents on Desir, and then paused and looked up. \u201cHuh? You\u2019re a commoner?\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Desir replied in a lackadaisical manner as if the question was irrelevant. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019re a commoner, you\u2019re probably going to experience some hardship, I guess? Even if you pass, they\u2019ll put you into the Beta class. They don\u2019t really care for commoner half of Hebrion; they won\u2019t give you a proper\r</p>",
    "<p>education there.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>This unexpected return to the past made a crucial fact slip his mind. Despite being the foremost magic academy on the continent, Hebrion was harshly segregated into two halves: the nobles of Alpha class, and the commoners of Beta class.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWell, it\u2019ll only matter if you pass your exam.\u201d Radoria then lead Desir down a long corridor.\r</p>",
    "<p>After 10 minutes, as if the long silence had bothered her, Radoria spoke again. \u201cOh, I forgot to ask before. Do you know what a Shadow World is?\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMore or less\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Radoria furrowed her brows in suspicion. \u201cDo you really know though? To join the effort against the Shadow Worlds, you need to have perfect knowledge of what they are. Even if this is just an examination-specific Shadow World, Shadow Worlds are still inherently dangerous you know.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Desir simply nodded at Radoria\u2019s explanation.\r</p>",
    "<p>She let out a small huff. \u201cAlright, if you\u2019re so confident then, why don\u2019t I test you with a few questions?\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cFirst question,\u201d Radoria\u2019s voice held a clear note of mockery. \u201cWhat is a Shadow World?\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Desir cleared his throat and began speaking:\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cShadow Worlds.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThey occur each year, and they are the most dangerous phenomenon mankind has ever seen. Like an infinitely long corridor with countless rooms on each side; there are countless worlds, each with their own bizarre set of rules.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThese worlds are a glimpse into the past, and each world has its own risks. While some Shadow Worlds are weak, others can be extremely dangerous. The Magic Society determines the power (and implicitly, the danger) of a Shadow World, and assigns it one of 10 classes. It\u2019s usually possible to estimate the number of deaths likely to occur by knowing the class of a Shadow World.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWithout a doubt, however, the most dangerous characteristic of a Shadow World is its potential for an \u2018Encroachment\u2019 event to occur. Encroached land is smothered in a thick, black fog, and it becomes impossible to know what\u2019s happening inside. Only one thing is certain: no living being has ever entered encroached land and returned alive. It is simply a place where life cannot exist.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis is why humanity must fight against the Shadow Worlds.\u201d</p>"
