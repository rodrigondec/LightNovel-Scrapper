    "<p>The carriage rattled as it carried along its path. Leaning towards the window, Desir admired the scenery. The large tracts of land set for farming stuck out in his mind. \u2018With so much abundant and fertile farmland, it\u2019s no wonder they\u2019re able to produce so much food. The Earl didn\u2019t make this decision on a whim.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Upon reaching the city borders, the carriage stopped outside of a shabby inn. The wood was worn and the door was creaky, but it stood the test of time and didn\u2019t smell of mould. That was enough.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cStay here and wait for me.\u201d Jefran walked into the inn and proceeded to secure accommodations for the two of them. Desir agreed and gave him a curt nod before noticing how sore he was from the carriage ride here. Once Desir got out of the carriage, he started to stretch. He felt much better after getting out of the cramped carriage. Suddenly, he felt something prodding him.</p>",
    "<p>He turned around, but couldn\u2019t find anybody there. As he was beginning to believe that nobody was there, he looked down to find an emaciated child with cracked lips. The vagrant girl cupped her hands in front of Desir and pleaded \u201cSir, could you spare some change? Please?\u201d The look in her eyes was desperate, and she couldn\u2019t disguise her exhaustion that was either from fatigue or starvation\u2014 or both.</p>",
    "<p>Desir rummaged through his pockets for something, anything to give to the little girl, but he didn\u2019t have a single coin to give her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t have any money either.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The little girl\u2019s eyes drooped; she looked like a tree one breeze from falling over. \u201cSigh\u2026 it can\u2019t be helped then.\u201d She turned around and wearily stumbled away from Desir. As she began departing, Desir called out to her and offered her four dried plums in an outstretched hand. \u201cIf it\u2019s food you want, I do have this.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Her face brightened and her eyes looked up at Desir, as if asking for permission. He smiled back and nodded approvingly at the little girl before handing her one of the dried plums. She devoured it ravenously, before eyeing the other dried plums avariciously.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDo you want more?\u201d The little girl nodded furiously in response. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things that I don\u2019t know. Would you be okay if I asked you some questions in exchange for these plums?\u201d There was no hesitation as she nodded again.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDo you live there?\u201d Desir pointed at the shantytown where the wanderers stayed.</p>",
    "<p>The little girl nodded. \u201cYep. I live with my mom and little brother. Just the three of us.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your dad?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDunno. Mom won\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir gave the little girl another plum. She ate it just as quickly as the first. \u201cI heard that they give you free food here. Isn\u2019t that true?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThey do. Every morning, they come from over there.\u201d She pointed over at the plaza. \u201cIf you wait in line, they give you food.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf so, then why\u2014\u201c Desir\u2019s words were cut short as he saw the little girl search for something in her pockets. She pulled it out as though she was handling a precious treasure: it was a piece of bread.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThey give us a piece of bread to eat every day, but it isn\u2019t enough. That\u2019s why Lilica is always hungry.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWho is Lilica?\u201d asked Desir. The little girl pointed at herself, and her stomach growled in hunger. In response, Desir handed her another dried plum. Like every other time, it disappeared within a matter of seconds.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSir, and your name?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou can call me Desir.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAlright, Desiiiir. Since you\u2019re so nice, I\u2019ll give you this.\u201d It was a handkerchief embroidered with flower patterns; he could tell that it took years to achieve this kind of masterful needlework. \u201cMy mom made it; she\u2019s super good at sewing. She even made my clothes!\u201d Lilica twirled around and showed off her dress.</p>",
    "<p>Desir was surprised that she gave him this. \u201cThis is beautiful. Are you sure that you don\u2019t want to sell this at the market? With your mom\u2019s workmanship, it should go for a good price.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cPeople told us not to come by the market. They said they\u2019d beat my mom to death if she came.\u201d She frowned as she recalled the memory. \u201cThey said we\u2019re thieves that steal everything. Besides Joffrey, they said that the other people who lived with us stole stuff from them. Even though we didn\u2019t steal anything, they keep calling us thieves. My mom told me to hold it in. She said that since we\u2019re not from here, it\u2019s natural for them to act like this.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHey Desir! Get over here! Now!\u201d Jefran\u2019s voice rang out as he called for his assistant. It was time to go. Desir needed to hurry back, so he handed the little girl the last dried plum. \u201cLilica, do you see that sun? When it\u2019s set about halfway, come to the castle\u2019s backdoor and I\u2019ll give you more food, okay?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWow\u2014 really? Okay!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMake sure that nobody sees you.\u201d After making sure she understood, Desir left and jogged back towards Jefran. Soon after, an notification rang out.</p>",
    "<p>| You have found the Problem #2: [Vagrants], one of the two problems within the Evernatten Domain.</p>",
    "<p>Lord Evernatten\u2019s Castle, 11:00am.</p>",
    "<p>After steam rose from the kettle and its aroma wafted through the office, Desir poured the tea into a silver teacup and then placed it onto a silver platter. Opening the chamber doors, he gently put the silver tray down in front of his Lordship, who was going through a stack of paperwork. He was a gruff older man with a face riddled with battle scars that was carved out by the countless seasons he has survived through. Working in silence, an air of intensity surrounded him.</p>",
    "<p>| You have encountered Unique Hero [Wilhelm Evernation]. This is a key figure in the main scenario.</p>",
    "<p>| Become close with him. Once the Earl\u2019s impression of you reaches [trustworthy], the main quest will begin. Currently, his impression of you is [favorable].</p>",
    "<p>\u2018If this person is a key figure in the Shadow World, then the main quest must be helping him solve the problems of the Evernation Domain.\u2019 Desir gently placed the teacup on top of the Earl\u2019s desk. Clearing the [Dinner Service-EX] quest, Desir was rewarded with the position of the Earl\u2019s assistant. The Earl\u2019s quill moved without rest, while his eyes remained fixed on the paperwork in front of him. He took a few casual sips of the tea, but otherwise remained taciturn.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018In order to trigger the main quest as soon as possible, I have to persuade the Earl that he can trust me; I have to solve the vagrant problem as soon as possible.\u2019 Desir tactfully observed the Earl. Aside from the quiet scratches on parchment and sips of tea, not a sound was present.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAhem.\u201d Desir cleared his throat. He wanted to start a casual conversation with the Earl. It was the best way to become friendly with him in a short time. \u201cIt\u2019s really cold today.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI see.\u201d The Earl answered back without looking up.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cShould I close the window for you?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cLeave it be.\u201d The Earl looked at Desir. A spectacular failure. This time, Desir tried to change the topic instead of making small talk. Looking at the paperwork piled on top of the Earl\u2019s desk, he concluded that there was so much paperwork that couldn\u2019t possibly be finished by one person.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMy lord, there appears to be a substantial amount of work to be done. Should you wish it, I would be happy to assist you with your work.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Wilhelm put down his tea and turned his attention over to Desir. \u201cDo you know how to read?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Earl Evernation put down his quill pen. \u201cThen I\u2019ll have you do one thing for me.\u201d Desir leaned closer to ensure that he caught every single word.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me while I am busy working. It\u2019s distracting.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>| Earl Wilhelm\u2019s impression of you has decreased from [favorable] to [neutral].</p>",
    "<p>\u2018I can\u2019t approach him using normal means. I need to look at this from a different direction.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Desir came to this conclusion after a few days in his new position as the Earl\u2019s assistant. After a disappointing first meeting, Desir tried his best to offer a good impression to the Earl: offering desserts, bringing various exotic teas, and cleaning the Earl\u2019s room ahead of time. Unfortunately, none of these had any affect on the Earl\u2019s temperament. Four days into the mission while Desir was thinking about how to earn the Earl\u2019s trust, the scenario began to split off into a new development.</p>",
    "<p>Castle Kitchen.</p>",
    "<p>To help Jefran whilst he was looking for a new assistant, Desir was preparing the onions in the kitchen by himself. With the door slightly ajar, a cute and mischievous eye appeared to ensure that the coast was clear. When he saw Desir, his pupils dilated before he popped out of the door and it flew wide open. The speedy shadow dashed straight at Desir and jumped, arms outstretched ready to envelop him. \u201cMr. Desir, guess who?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir was startled and turned around to see his nimble party member in the flesh. \u201cPram? How did you get here? Ouch! Hold on!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSorry! I couldn\u2019t help myself after finding you.\u201d Pram let go of his tight embrace and took a step back.</p>",
    "<p>Seeing Pram\u2019s appearance, he noticed that his party member was wearing the uniform of the Evernatten guards. \u201cSo you started off as a guard, huh?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes, sir! As a guard, I was able to roam around the castle. That\u2019s why it was easy to find you. Besides that, do you know how long I\u2019ve been looking for you?!\u201d Pram\u2019s distressed face was extremely close to Desir\u2019s face. Desir took a step back and apologized.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSorry, there\u2019s been a lot going on.\u201d He briefed Pram on what had transpired so far in the Orrane region. He mentioned the wanderers living outside of the city, and the disparate treatment that they were receiving from the townsfolk. Desir also mentioned Lilica, the young girl he met outside the walls.</p>",
    "<p>After catching up with Desir, Pram forgave him and the two of them huddled together to discuss the Shadow World. \u201cSo\u2026 it seems like this Shadow World is based on the Holy Empire?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>In response to Pram\u2019s question, Desir nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve confirmed it. A few days ago, I took a moment to leave the castle. I found that the city\u2019s architecture resembles that of the Holy Empire.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBut Desir, wasn\u2019t the Holy Empire\u2014\u201c</p>",
    "<p>\u201cRight. The entire territory was swallowed up by the Shadow World, short of the Orrane region where we currently reside.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s weird: it feels out of place to be in a country that\u2019s already met its end. It\u2019s completely different from where we\u2019re from.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWell, it is your first time in a Shadow World.\u201d Desir smiled at Pram, reminiscing of his first time.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it the same for you too?\u201d Being caught off-guard, Desir rose from his seat.</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026Just wait here for a moment. I\u2019ll bring you something to eat.\u201d</p>"
