    "<p>| The final quest has been revealed.</p>",
    "<p>[Quest objective: Stop the clock tower.]</p>",
    "<p>| At the top of the clock tower lies the power source of the clock. Destroy the</p>",
    "<p>power source, and the clock tower will stop.</p>",
    "<p>The door creaked behind them as the Blue Moon party entered the clock tower. To their surprise, what greeted them was no sound of ticking gears, or multitude of traps set for intruders.</p>",
    "<p>Instead, six survivors stood in a loose semi-circle, chattering furiously amongst themselves. But as they saw Ajest cross into the tower, the tense conversation rapidly ceased. A silence fell over the tower as all eyes were turned towards her.</p>",
    "<p>Ajest looked around carefully. \u201c2 eliminated,\u201d she said softly, to nobody in particular. There were 16 remaining survivors; of them 13 were standing here. However, it was also clear that the wind mage wasn\u2019t among the 13. Ajest was now certain that the sniper belonged to Desir\u2019s party.</p>",
    "<p>A soft breeze blew through the room, momentarily interrupting the mounting tension. Before the Blue Moon party had entered, the other two, more medium sized parties, had been sizing each other up. They had similar strength and similar numbers; consequently, it would hardly have been strange if a fight broke out right then and there.</p>",
    "<p>However, the appearance of the Blue Moon party considerably changed the situation. The Blue Moon party had the most survivors; the other parties\u2019</p>",
    "<p>leaders weren\u2019t idiots, and it was bluntly obvious that, as smaller parties, infighting amongst themselves would only be detrimental.</p>",
    "<p>The two parties exchanged nervous glances. Then, without a word, they moved in unison to block the Blue Moon party\u2019s path.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAll members, form ranks.\u201d Ajest\u2019s dispassionate voice rang out, and the party moved in unison. 3 tankers moved to the front immediately; behind them stood 2 knights with their swords drawn and ready. A lone mage stood at the back, and magic formulas quickly filled the air in front of them. Their matching uniforms and neat, crisp movements gave them a near-overwhelming presence.</p>",
    "<p>But the other survivors had, after all, also made it all the way to the end, and now they too quickly moved into their own formation. 2 members with shields moved to the front, with a knight just behind them. Then, behind that, stood 2 archers, with bowstrings drawn, and 1 mage of their own.</p>",
    "<p>Both parties eyed each other cautiously, each waiting for the other to move. The tension was so thick one could almost cut it with a knife.</p>",
    "<p>Ajest pulled out her sword. A blue light shined from its blade.</p>",
    "<p>A voice rang out from the impromptu party alliance. \u201cThe sniper was in the Blue Moon party, as expected.\u201d The man who spoke began walking towards the Blue Moon party. 1st year, rank 2. Gabriel Ijente. 3rd circle fire mage.</p>",
    "<p>Ajest raised an eyebrow in response, and asked, \u201c\u2026you were also getting sniped at?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cCut the crap. Only the Blue Moon party could possibly have a sniper of that caliber.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest narrowed her eyes. It wasn\u2019t because of anything Gabriel had just said, but rather, she now realized. \u2018We weren\u2019t the only ones Desir Arman was sniping.\u2019 He had clearly found the clock tower first. But instead of continuing the quest,</p>",
    "<p>he had instead elected to gather every other party. \u2018Does he think he can snipe us all down? But that doesn\u2019t make sense. He wouldn\u2019t give up his enormous lead on the quest progression for such a reckless plan.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Ajest blinked slowly as comprehension dawned on her. \u201cClearing the quest wasn\u2019t his objective,\u201d she thought aloud.</p>",
    "<p>Ijente frowned. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Without a word in response, Ajest took a step forward. Her eyes were already behind him.</p>",
    "<p>He blinked. She disappeared. A cloud of dust exploded from where she had stood. In an instant, Ajest\u2019s sword was past him.</p>",
    "<p>There was no warning. Ijente turned to look down at his body. As he did, he faded into tiny motes of light.</p>",
    "<p>| A contestant has been eliminated. 15 contestants remain.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAahhh! The party leader died!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEveryone, charge!\u201d The screams ran out from panicked students.</p>",
    "<p>Ajest calmly surveyed her charging opponents, and flicked her sword in her hand. \u20185 people\u2026and spectators.\u2019 She looked up. She couldn\u2019t see deep into the dark tower, but it didn\u2019t matter. She knew they had to be there. \u201cAll members, stop Desir\u2019s party\u2019s sniper,\u201d she ordered as she pointed at the stairs.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAll members!? What about these guys right here?\u201d Percival replied, incredulous at the absurd order.</p>",
    "<p>She looked back over the other survivors. Without hesitation, she cooly responded, \u201cI\u2019ll take out the five of them myself.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAll\u2014all five!? By yourself?\u201d he spit out in disbelief.</p>",
    "<p>Ajest never answered him. She had already entered the fight.</p>",
    "<p>A low, whining creak came from the rusted hinges of the door as it swung open.</p>",
    "<p>A silhouette illuminated against the open doorway. As the figure silently drew closer, it came into view. It was a girl, wearing a strange leather coat embedded with metal plating. Blood ran down the side of body, leaving a trail of droplets as she walked. She held a blade in her hand. Blue light glowed along its edge. Her long, platinum hair was unmarked by blood, striking a sharp contrast as it flowed behind her.</p>",
    "<p>She examined the three of them as she approached, like a lion stalking its quarry. Instinctively, his party members shifted back behind him.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cA pointless scheme.\u201d Her voice was ice cold.</p>",
    "<p>Desir\u2019s face froze at the criticism. \u201cIt would have worked if not for you.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>He meant it, truly. After all, his opponent was Ajest Kingscrown. She was the strongest spellsword in all of Hebrion, and one of the six who had survived to the very end. When they\u2019d all united under the Expedition\u2019s banner, she had been the commander, so gifted was she in battle.</p>",
    "<p>Desir had expected her to figure out his plans, to some extent, anyways\u2014it wasn\u2019t as if his plans had been suddenly, unexpectedly seen through. Rather, he had made quite the serious miscalculation. \u201cTo think that you would take out every remaining survivor by yourself,\u201d he said softly, in admiring tones.</p>",
    "<p>The fight that Desir had wanted had happened. But Ajest had given him no room to interfere. The entirety of the Blue Moon party, minus Ajest, had masterfully obstructed Desir\u2019s party while Ajest single-handedly humiliated the</p>",
    "<p>other survivors. They could do nothing but watch as she subdued them, took them hostage, and dragged them to a safe area.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhile we kept your party from doing anything, our party captured the remaining survivors. There\u2019s still over 10 alive,\u201d Ajest stated coldly. Clearly, there would be no way to even touch the 10 downstairs without going through Ajest first. Their plan had been utterly ruined. They had one choice left.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe only thing left is a head-to-head fight.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica and Pram stood by Desir\u2019s side. Percival and Doneta stood behind Ajest. Light fell in from a single, tiny window at the far end of the corridor, illuminating the two groups in a pale, weak light. Each faced the other wordlessly, straining to read their thoughts from movements of their silhouettes. The sound of titanic gears grinding as they moved past each other echoed through the narrow corridor.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYour party and mine. Defeat me and prove that you\u2019re worthy of the title of Single Ranker, Desir Arman!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The gears stopped. Ajest began moving. Magic power swirled around her as her mana gathered and condensed, taking shape.</p>",
    "<p>Desir immediately began his analysis. He had the ability to deduce what spell would be cast just by looking at the casting process, before the spell was even complete.</p>",
    "<p>[Frozen Jail.]</p>",
    "<p>Pillars of ice, elaborately engraved, rose out of the ground, emanating a deep chill through the air. But Desir\u2019s party felt nothing.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHijack complete,\u201d he announced triumphantly. Under Desir\u2019s control, the magic couldn\u2019t affect his party\u2019s surroundings.</p>",
    "<p>With a hiss, the pillars disappeared into a thick vapor, as Ajest immediately ended the spell in response. The dense fog filled the corridor, blocking everyone\u2019s view.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming!\u201d Pram shouted as he stepped forward and swung his rapier. He felt it land. At the same time, he twisted his head to the right. A sword sliced neatly through the space where his head had just been. The fog scattered in the wind, revealing Doneta. Without missing a step, Pram saw Doneta\u2019s improper stance and thrust the rapier at his stomach.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOof!\u201d   Doneta grunted in pain as he twisted back. Romantica immediately followed up, sending her spell screaming towards him.</p>",
    "<p>[Wind Strike!]</p>",
    "<p>The bullet of compressed air exploded, but there was no announcement. Instead, a gigantic shield appeared out of the dispersing fog. Percival\u2019s sneering face appeared behind the lowered shield. \u201cWeak as sheet for a 2nd circle spell,\u201d he spit at Romantica contemptuously.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m exhausted after sniping so much, you moron!\u201d Romantica shouted back in a fit.</p>",
    "<p>The fog returned, filling the space between them again and erasing them from each others\u2019 vision. Doneta whispered to Percival, \u201cthat swordsman\u2026looks strong. Be careful.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Percival scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019re just weak, you idiot.\u201d He\u2019d faced Pram once before. According to his memory, Pram wasn\u2019t a particularly skilled swordsman. His sword was a bit fast for Beta Class, but that was it. Pram was hopeless; he\u2019d exhaust himself soon after the fight began.</p>",
    "<p>He charged. \u201cEat this!\u201d He swung his sword at Pram, but, surprisingly, sliced only thin air. \u201cWhat?\u201d Percival stopped, bewildered, as he realized he couldn\u2019t see anything in the fog. He looked back, just in case, and was nearly hit as he</p>",
    "<p>barely managed to parry Pram\u2019s surprise attack. He ground his teeth. \u201cYou cheap bastard.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou did it first.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The echo of steel on steel rang out through the tower.</p>",
    "<p>Born and raised in the north, Percival\u2019s sword style was wild and savage. He preferred to use his strength to simply beat into his opponent, without giving them a moment\u2019s rest and wear them down over time. The Pawn-rank swordsman\u2019s talent was just starting to bloom and his sword was already fierce. He attacked at an oppressive speed. At the same time, he protected himself with his shield as he advanced, like a towering mountain.</p>",
    "<p>Pram was a speed-focused swordsman, much like Percival. Unfortunately, he had neither the strength nor the force Percival did, which meant, in theory, that he would be hard pressed to gain an advantage in this fight.</p>",
    "<p>Indeed, to everyone else, it appeared like Pram was getting pushed back. But, to Percival\u2019s growing discomfort, it soon became clear it was quite the opposite. Each of Pram\u2019s movements were calculated. At every moment, he would dodge or parry Percival\u2019s blade with the smallest movement possible, keeping his positioning tight and constantly looking for openings.</p>",
    "<p>He kept his distance, and warded his opponent off with only the tip of his sword as he danced gracefully around the room. At this rate, the longer the fight drew out, the more Pram would be at an advantage.</p>",
    "<p>Pram was well aware of his limits. He avoided letting the duel turn into a contest of strength, and attacked Percival\u2019s openings whenever he could. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, Percival felt his sword getting pushed back. It was clear that he would lose if this kept up.</p>",
    "<p>Backed against a wall, Percival made a desperate gamble. He threw his shield at Pram.</p>"
