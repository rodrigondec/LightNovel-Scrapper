    "<p>\u201cReally? How come?\u201d, asked Pram.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou\u2019re already a fully-fledged swordsman\u2014you know all the basics, have great senses, and your flow isn\u2019t bad,\u201d noted Desir. \u201cYou are apt at finding a flaw in your opponent\u2019s stance, and would not have any problems going to the promotion battle right now. Even the Alpha Class has few people matching your skills.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir recalled Pram from his memories. His gallant figure charged into the heart of the enemy, holding only a silver rapier. The sliver of a sword raced across the battlefield, striking at the speed of lightning. A true King-rank swordsman and living legend amongst the survivors.</p>",
    "<p>But that was in the future.</p>",
    "<p>Desir remarked, \u201cOf course, that would require you to relinquish the greatsword in exchange for a rapier.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram failed to meet Desir\u2019s eyes as he gripped the greatsword tightly. He became silent and discovered a newfound interest in the floorboards.</p>",
    "<p>Desir noticed his reluctance and simply asked, \u201cWhy won\u2019t you use the rapier, Pram?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMust you ask?\u201d whined Pram.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis concerns the overall strength of the party, so yes,\u201d said Desir.</p>",
    "<p>Pram lowered his greatsword. Their eyes met. Desir saw a touch of vulnerability in Pram\u2019s eyes. \u201cThen\u2026 could you come with me?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The overcast sky gave hints of dusk approaching. Rain was sure to come in the next few hours, but none of that compared to Pram\u2019s appearance. His face darkened with each word:</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know my father.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not because he died when I was young. He was a noble, and my mother was a commoner. I was a bastard, simple as that. Even so, we used to be pretty well-off.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThinking back, I think he provided for us. My mother didn\u2019t even know how to stitch.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram unlocked the door to his dormitory, and let Desir in.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEvery night before we slept, she would always tell me about what a wonderful person he was. She was so proud of him,\u201d explained Pram. With each word, loneliness crept onto Pram\u2019s face. Soon, there was none of the bright-eyed boy who stood in front of him just a few hours earlier. Desir waited patiently in the living room as Pram went to retrieve a leather sheath. As Desir received the guard, he inspected the weapon\u2014inside was a rapier.</p>",
    "<p>The grip was made of a high quality oak. There was some unintelligible scribbling on the handle, but most shocking was the weight. It was incredibly light for a sword, to the point where it would be impossible to use the weight of the sword in his attacks.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhen I was 6, my mother told me that my father left this rapier for us,\u201d said Pram. \u201cThat was why I learned the sword\u2014to become proficient enough that my father would have nothing but pride for me when we finally met,\u201d Pram claimed with sparkling eyes. \u201cMy mother was always worried about it. I think she never wanted me to meet my father.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram gave Desir a bittersweet smile as he reminisced. \u201cMy mother never told me his name\u2014not even once. Instead, she always told me that I should never go looking for my father. I get it\u2014I really do. There\u2019s no way that a highborn noble family would accept a bastard. She never told me his name, even on her deathbed.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>A bastard was a disgrace; in the case of Pram, he wasn\u2019t even the son of a concubine. If a commoner appeared at a noble\u2019s doorstep and said he was a bastard, the result was obvious. She kept her silence to protect her son.</p>",
    "<p>Regardless, Pram wanted to know his father\u2019s name. Despite his mother\u2019s concerns, he always wanted to meet his father.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cCall it curiosity. Isn\u2019t it just human to want to meet your father?\u201d asked Pram. \u201cThat\u2019s why I came here - with so many nobles gathered, I would definitely be able to find a clue to my father\u2019s whereabouts.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir nodded in agreement.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI had the rapier inspected as soon as I got here\u2014my only lead. With weapons from all around the world gathered here, there had to be somebody who could give me a clue based on this rapier.\u201d Pram\u2019s eyes hardened.</p>",
    "<p>Desir inspected the blade. Although the handle was extremely high quality, the blade itself was worthless. The silver plating had worn off, and revealed a rusted iron within. It resembled a toy more than a weapon.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe result is in your hands. It\u2019s made of a cheap iron that could be from anywhere. The only thing that my father left my mother was a worthless iron sword,\u201d said Pram softly. He looked close to tears as he spoke. Desir could tell those weren\u2019t tears of anguish, but of betrayal.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI can\u2019t bear it. I can\u2019t bear that after all these years I wishing to meet my father, all he left for us was this worthless thing. That\u2019s my reason. I will never use the rapier again,\u201d croaked Pram.</p>",
    "<p>Pram retrieved the rapier from Desir, and threw it to the side in frustration.</p>",
    "<p>The greatsword cut through the air with a powerful slash. Pram was practicing his swings. The most fundamental move\u2014an important step to understanding the sword.</p>",
    "<p>Desir watched his display with apprehension. \u2018It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that Pram has no talent for the greatsword\u2026 it would be pointless to even teach him.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>The greatsword was not designed for accuracy, but for its crushing weight. Utilizing the slow and destructive strength of the broad weapon required training to handle its hefty weight. Pram\u2019s physique did not meet any of the conditions in training with the greatsword, but were rather optimized for a rapier.</p>",
    "<p>Much of this was due to habit\u2014based on Pram\u2019s story, he trained with the rapier for at least 10 years. If he had switched to the greatsword recently after he had the rapier appraised, he had been using the greatsword for less than two weeks. It would take many times more than that to break his ingrained habits.</p>",
    "<p>Desir sighed at the thought. Everything would be resolved if Pram simply picked up the rapier, but he was taciturn in his answer. Desir was frustrated, but did understand Pram\u2019s feelings. If he were Pram, he would likely do the same thing.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018It\u2019s still too early to give up.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Desir hung on to one major flaw in Pram\u2019s story\u2014something that didn\u2019t add up that even Pram couldn\u2019t know about. His future.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018In my past life, he used the rapier.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Pram Schneizer and his rapier were inseparable. That was a fact. Through his honed skills, he gained accolades and found himself at the apex of the blade, even being named Sword Master. His future was completely different, and in that was where Desir found his clue.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018There must be a clue. Something that shook his heart and made him take up the rapier again.\u2019 Desir walked up to Pram and cleared his throat to get his attention. \u2018With that, there\u2019s only one thing it could be\u2014his father\u2019s heirloom.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Pram stopped his swinging and turned to face his party member.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSorry for getting in the way of your training,\u201d said Desir sheepishly.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d responded Pram.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat sword you showed me yesterday\u2014could you let me see it one more time?\u201d asked Desir.</p>",
    "<p>Pram\u2019s ever gentle expression froze at the mention of the weapon. His face was marked with anxiety.</p>",
    "<p>Desir tried to appeal to Pram. \u201cI know it is rude of me to ask this, but could you please do me a favour and show it to me one more time?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEven if you say that, it\u2019s impossible,\u201d replied Pram bluntly.</p>",
    "<p>Pram raised his head. The next four words that came out of his mouth were completely out of Desir\u2019s expectations.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019ve already sold it.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>| This stop is the Business Sector.</p>",
    "<p>Stepping off the bus, they were enamoured by the sight of a wide avenue lined with thousands of street lights. The hustle and bustle of the street vendors as they bartered with the city folk was lively. The crossroads, plaza, and even the alleys were filled to the brim with shops as far as the eye can see. This sector was the only area in Hebrion Academy open to the public. People from across the world would come to inspect their wares, and the crowded streets left barely any space to move, save for a few small gaps.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cCan I ask you one thing? Why did you sell your sword?\u201d questioned Desir.</p>",
    "<p>Passing by a smith\u2019s stall with swords on display, Pram examined the swords available. \u201cIt became clear to me during our talk, Mr. Desir. That sword was of no help to me,\u201d said Pram politely.</p>",
    "<p>Desir realized that he had changed the future\u2014Pram may never use the rapier ever again in his life. He shook his head to get rid of the thought.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018It\u2019s not too late. The most important thing now is to find a reason for Pram to use the rapier.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>The two students entered an alley, covered in a shadow cast by the nearby roofs. As they travelled deeper into the alleyway, fewer and fewer stalls propped themselves out for display. Eventually, the two made their way to a large, imposing building in the distance.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI can\u2019t see why there\u2019s a store all the way out here,\u201d said Desir with a tinge of doubt.</p>",
    "<p>Pram responded, \u201cThey said they also purchase illegal goods. That\u2019s probably why.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The building was adorned with marble, with a simple sign written in Common in front of the door.</p>",
    "<p>Ujukun\u2019s Antique Shop. The most trusted shop in Hebrion Academy for antique appraisals and purchases. Do not touch unsold items. No refunds even if you change your mind. No refunds for damaged items. No refunds under any circumstances.</p>",
    "<p>Desir frowned. There was another line obscured when Desir originally read the sign.</p>",
    "<p>Top-class security always present. Cannot guarantee the lives of thieves.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cLooks hard-fisted,\u201d said Desir. He fanned himself with his hands as he read over the sign again, ensuring that he didn\u2019t miss any additional information.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAre you planning on going in?\u201d Pram asked.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019ll say it as many times as you want\u2014I will not use that rapier,\u201d said Pram crassly.</p>",
    "<p>As Desir entered the shop, Pram followed in resignation. After they passed through a narrow hallway, they came to a stop in a beautiful passageway with a glittering chandelier descending from the center of the ceiling. At the end of the hall, an imposing steel door laid shut. Pram rapped against the door using the steel knocker fashioned in the shape of a wolf.</p>",
    "<p>Moments later, a man emerged from inside. His stature was much taller than the average man, looking to be one of the northern barbarians\u2014a giant. As Pram and Desir entered, the door was slammed shut behind them. A roar echoed across the hall as the steel door was closed yet again. Silence filled the hall.</p>"
