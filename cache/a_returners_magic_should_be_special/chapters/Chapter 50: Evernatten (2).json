    "<p>The ear-piercing cry of a crow woke Desir in the morning.</p>",
    "<p>Rubbing his sleepy eyes, Desir sat up and picked up the cup of water next to his bed. The water smelled fishy and tasted bitter, but nonetheless he drank it to quench his thirst. Still groggy, he slipped out of his bed and walked into the washroom. A splash of cold water to the face helped to wake him up fully.</p>",
    "<p>It had been 8 days since he had entered the Class 4 Shadow World. In real time, only 8 hours have passed. In that time, Desir had finally managed to start the Main Quest. While the difficulty was high, everything had been progressing smoothly.</p>",
    "<p>When he first arrived, he was assigned the role of assistant chef. Under Jefran\u2019s command, Desir completed the dinner service. He brilliantly incorporated the rare plum ingredient into the dinner service and earned a favourable impression with the lord. By recommendation, he successfully got appointed as the personal assistant to the lord.</p>",
    "<p>However, since the lord was not a talkative person, Desir had a difficult time impressing him. Still, with the help of Pram, they managed to impress the lord by foiling the barbarian\u2019s raid on the food supplies. Thanks to that, the Main Quest was already half completed as soon as it was revealed. This was due to the peace treaty that Desir made with the barbarian chief, solving one of the two problems that Evernatten faced.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Now the only problem left is the vagrant situation.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>After his simple morning preparations, Desir headed to the lord\u2019s office. As he was walking by the castle\u2019s hallway, he stopped to observe outside. Someone was making a giant snowball.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHello Lilica.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHi big brother Desir!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Lilica waved at Desir, looking more lively than the first time they met.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat are you doing over there?\u201d asked Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m building a snowman! Do you want to help?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe have to prepare food.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOh right!\u201d Lilica looked as if she had only just remembered her job.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m heading to the kitchen too, so let\u2019s walk there together.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThank you brother Desir~!\u201d shouted Lilica as she made her way towards Desir. In her hands there was a miniature snowman. \u201cI\u2019m going to decorate the kitchen with this.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAre you sure mister Jefran would approve?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The innocent child smiling at him was a vagrant that Desir had met recently. When Jefran complained about the lack of personnel, Desir jokingly recommended Lilica to him. However, it seemed like Lilica was inherently talented and easily replaced Desir as an assistant chef. Naturally, she was too small to handle any major physical work, such as transporting all the ingredients, so Desir still helped with those.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhy are you heading to the kitchen? Didn\u2019t we move all the ingredients last night?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to brew some tea.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cTea? Didn\u2019t the lord say that you don\u2019t need to serve him tea anymore?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHe did, but you don\u2019t need to take him so literally.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>When Desir and Lilica arrived at the kitchen, they were greeted by Jefran\u2019s frowning face.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhere were you this morning Lilica?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHehe, I was making a snowman!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll catch a cold if you play outside too long! If you get sick, who will help me in the kitchen?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Was this old geezer always like this? Why is he so nice to her?\u2019</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHey,\u201d said Desir, feeling a bit annoyed, \u201chow come you treat Lilica so much better than me?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cUnlike you, Lilica is cute.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir was at a loss for words. Rather than replying, he focused on brewing some tea and left for the lord\u2019s office. There was now a small desk in the room just for him.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cGood morning, my lord.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir served the tea to the lord and went to his personal desk. There was paperwork piled up on top of his desk. His job was to organize the paperwork and handle smaller tasks that didn\u2019t require the lord\u2019s approval. Once Desir sorted out the papers, he would present them to the lord.</p>",
    "<p>Most of the paperwork were related to the management of the Evernatten territory. From them, Desir was able to learn the finer details about the overall situation of Evernatten while working. He now had access to important information that wasn\u2019t available to him before.</p>",
    "<p>For example, there was a detailed map. In the modern era, documentation about the Holy Nation was poor since it was swallowed up by the Shadow World. Additionally, magic was not well developed back then, meaning a detailed map was difficult to create. Finally, printing technology was not available, so only the affluent could afford to own a map.</p>",
    "<p>Thus, most modern era maps of the Holy Nation were created through guesswork by mages that had visited related Shadow Worlds. In comparison, the map that Desir received after being appointed the role of Tactician was better than any other map he had seen before.</p>",
    "<p>After studying the map, Desir concluded that Evernatten was the front line of defense for the Holy Nation. It was the nation\u2019s shield against barbarian invasions.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018It\u2019s a small sized territory.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Compared to other territories, Desir could see that Evernatten wasn\u2019t big at all.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Even so, it maintains a military force big enough for a large sized territory.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Evernatten\u2019s military force was excessively large for its territory size. One might even question if the territory could financially sustain such a large militia.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Is it because it\u2019s the front line of defense?\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Not only was the militia well equipped and trained, most of the units were Knight-ranked as well. They have won almost all of their battles against the barbarians. It is said that Lord Evernatten had never lost a battle that he personally led. His leadership was superb.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018And at the same time, he is governing the territory extremely well.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Evernatten utilized its large militia as a source of income. Only Evernatten had enough forces to resist barbarian invasions. Whenever nearby territories were under threat of such an invasion, Wilhelm Evernatten would send his knights and receive monetary compensation which would, in turn, finance other operations. Word would spread of Evernatten repeatedly repelling the barbarians in the north and merchants, who now felt safe in the territory, began expanding their economic activities.</p>",
    "<p>Five years ago, Evernatten was struggling due to barbarian raids, which left public order in disarray and merchants avoided the territory. It was during this time that Wilhelm, who was appointed lordship over Evernatten, decided to expand the military. With just that, the lord managed to reverse the situation in just five years.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018And so, we only have one last problem persisting in the territory.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>[Vagrants (Progress 30%): Public order has been restored and crime rates have fallen significantly. The residents of the territory feel secure walking around the streets. Vagrants cannot commit any crimes due to strict oversight.]</p>",
    "<p>\u2018There are so many vagrants that they even formed slum cities just for vagrants.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Most vagrants did not have social standing, making it easy for criminals to be mixed in with them. It was understandable that most lords would not want to accept vagrants into their territory. However, that wasn\u2019t the case with Wilhelm Evernatten. He was more generous than any other lord and accepted every single vagrant into his territory.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018By accepting vagrants, our food supplies and public order are directly affected.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Currently there were no issues with the food supply. Even if the lord continued to accept vagrants, the food supply would just barely suffice.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018While food supplies aren\u2019t an issue, I should take a look at the public order\u2026\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Desir reviewed the crime rate documents for the territory. With the insurgence of vagrants, crime had also increased significantly. There were many complaints from the regular residents. Desir noticed an interesting report. Since the day his party entered the Shadow World, the crime rates had been declining sharply. The reason for this was fairly simple.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018This is\u2026Ajest\u2019s work, right?\u2019</p>",
    "<p>***</p>",
    "<p>Heading out of the castle and crossing the drawbridge, Desir made his way towards the headquarters of the Knights. When he arrived, Desir gave his name to one of the guards and they welcomed him warmly.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHello Mr. Desir. Our captain is expecting you.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir followed the guard into the building and up to the second floor. There were many rooms on the second floor, each with a door bearing the name of the Knight that lived inside. Desir continued up one more floor and walked towards the furthest room. Hearing voices from within, he paused in front of the door.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t we taking any action!?\u201d It was a female voice speaking in a harsh tone.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat is not something that I alone can decide,\u201d replied the voice of Ajest. Her response was cold and brunt, causing the other person to yell louder.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cCaptain, if we let things go as it is, the food supplies will decline and crime rates will increase. We must take action now!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>They were clearly talking about the vagrants.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s our job to prevent that from happening,\u201d replied Ajest.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe solution is simple. The vagrants are the root cause. After receiving the lord\u2019s protection, they only waste Evernatten\u2019s food supplies and do nothing in return. This all started because the lord accepted all these vagrants! We must remove them immediately!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWatch your mouth, Lieutenant Eyulan,\u201d said Ajest coldly. Desir shivered. The tone was overwhelming. It wasn\u2019t only Desir who felt it. Eyulan was also at a loss for words.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHowever\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAre you suggesting that you have the authority to trample over our lord\u2019s decision?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026I got too emotional and misspoke. I am truly sorry,\u201d said Eyulan. It was certainly not something a Knight could say to a lord.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019ll take your words into consideration. You are dismissed.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir heard approaching footsteps and moved away from the door, making room for the conversants to pass. Eyulan opened the door and saw Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she asked.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m Desir Arman,\u201d replied Desir light-heartedly. As soon as she heard Desir\u2019s name, Eyulan gave him a disdainful look, as if he was an insect.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWipe that smug look off your face, you damn vagrant\u2026\u201d whispered Eyulan as she walked past, loud enough for Desir to hear clearly. She left regretting that she could not behead Desir on the spot. As her footsteps faded in the distance, Desir entered the room. Ajest greeted him warmly.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWelcome Desir, it\u2019s been so long!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHow long have you been working here?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSince the start. As the captain, I\u2019ve been working on the Main Quest since day 1.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat? How unfair,\u201d said Desir. As an assistant chef, Desir had to work to his bones. However, the frown of dissatisfaction that he was showing Ajest was playful and soon turned into a smile. Ajest was also smiling gently. She motioned Desir to sit.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard rumours around the castle that you can brew some excellent tea.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you some tea the next time I visit.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI look forward to it. I\u2019ve been missing your tea.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest rested her chin on the table and smiled at Desir. From Desir\u2019s perspective, it looked like a beautiful piece of artwork. Taken aback by her beauty, Desir returned the stare blankly for moment. However, he quickly recovered and changed the topic.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHow\u2019s the quest progressing?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working on it. The progression isn\u2019t so bad.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cTell me what you have been doing so far.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHm\u2026\u201d Ajest pondered for a moment. Then she nodded, \u201crather than telling you, I think it\u2019s best to show you.\u201d</p>"
