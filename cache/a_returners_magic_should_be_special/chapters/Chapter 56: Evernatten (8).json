    "<p>Romantica was wearing luxurious clothes spun from obviously high quality material. Even Eyulan could not deny this.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cRegardless of who you really are,\u201d said Eyulan, \u201cthis crisis involving the vagrants and the food supply is impossible to resolve.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you revealing your intentions a bit too much? You sound like a middle-aged woman saying that we should just give up without even trying,\u201d countered Romantica harshly, \u201cif someone told me there was a solution, I would smile and ask for the details.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIn any case,\u201d continued Romantica, \u201cyou\u2019re very rude. Did you grow up in a place where it\u2019s okay to cut into other people\u2019s conversations? Before you boast about your own importance, shouldn\u2019t you consider that the person you\u2019re talking to might be even more important? Ah\u2026maybe this type of thinking is beyond your abilities? Are you just a muscle brained knight?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica\u2019s words were disparaging, but Eyulan was unable to rebuff her. All she could do was make a show of her displeasure, but it was all bark and no bite.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cRomantica,\u201d whispered Desir quietly, \u201cwhat role did you get when you entered the Shadow World?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI thought you would never ask.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica whistled loudly, rousing a youth in the crowd. He handed her something bound in black leather. Romantica casually checked the object before handing it over to Desir. It was a ledger. Desir\u2019s stood agape as he received it.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m a merchant,\u201d said Romantica, \u201cand I will solve the vagrant issue the merchant way.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cReally? This is\u2026\u201d Desir was amazed.</p>",
    "<p>That feeling of amazement did not fade as Romantica led them into a forest near the gates. Those accompanying him shared his sentiment. Their eyes were wide and jaws hung open.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWha-wha-wha!?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Horse-drawn carriages and wagons were lined up, filling the entire forest. They were not small in size, with each of the 30 massive carriages requiring four horses each. There were also countless workers managing the wagons.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis\u2026is impossible. What is\u2026\u201d As the knight stood dumbfounded, Desir and his party walked ahead. The workers managing the carriages were all wearing the same uniform and all greeted Romantica respectfully as she passed.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis is a merchant group lead by me,\u201d explained Romantica, \u201cwe usually deal with medical product but, well, we recently had to shift our focus in a major way.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica walked over to one of the wagons and revealed its cargo. The wagon was filled to the brim with food supplies. There were all kinds of products, including wheat.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI got news that all the vagrants were gathering in Evernatten. From the sheer number of them all, I knew that there was no way Evernatten could sustain them all, so I predicted that value of food to skyrocket.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Compared to other merchant groups, Romantica\u2019s merchant guild was doing pretty well. She had dominated the market not only in her headquarter\u2019s local area, but in the surrounding territories as well. Romantica\u2019s outstanding business sense had ushered in a golden age for her guild.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAnd so I went all in.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica had directed the guild to liquidate a significant amount of its assets in order to purchase food. This was a bold move, foolhardy even. But it might have been this sort of aggressive thinking that had help the guild grow in power. Romantica gathered information, analyzed it thoroughly, created a plan, and executed it without holding anything back.</p>",
    "<p>Of course, things didn\u2019t always go to plan. It wasn\u2019t possible to account for all scenarios or gather perfect information every time. This is where business sense was important. Although betting everything on a \u201cgut feeling\u201d meant you would risk losing everything, Romantica was fortunate thus far that her business sense had always resulted in the most favourable outcomes.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe were almost robbed by bandits on the way here, but we managed to fend them off. Now I understand why you worked so hard to make me a Third Circle mage.\u201d Romantica showed off the rifle she was carrying. Desir felt sorry for the bandit group.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo Ajest,\u201d asked Romantica, \u201cis this enough food?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest was meticulously studying the inventory and calculating the amount of food brought by Romantica as well as the amount remaining in Evernatten.</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026We should be able to hold out through the winter with this much.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Being able to feed everyone through the winter was no longer just a dream. The combined food supply greatly improved the situation. It could even be said that they would never have to worry about food again. Colour began returning to Desir\u2019s face.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d said Desir, \u201cthis is really great, Romantica.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m great right? Praise me more.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cGenuinely, you deserve all the praise. This is quite an achievement. I\u2019m truly grateful, Romantica.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to go that far,\u201d stammered Romantica, \u201cit\u2019s not that big of a deal. I\u2019m giving you all the food even if you don\u2019t praise me that much.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMiss Romantica,\u201d interjected Emil, \u201cyou\u2019re not thinking about giving away the food for free are you?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHm? Why not?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf you do that\u2026the guild will go bankrupt\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The pleading look in her employee\u2019s eyes made Romantica feel guilty. She had lost sight of her position as the leader of the merchant guild as she wasn\u2019t originally from the Shadow World. If she carried out this decision, she would be betraying the expectations of the people that had believed in her and followed her all the way here.</p>",
    "<p>[Sub-quest created! Trade with Evernatten:</p>",
    "<p>Due to outstanding business acumen, a merchant has acquired and brought over enough food to sustain the Evernatten region through the winter. Since the food represents the entirety of the merchant\u2019s available assets, giving it away for free will ruin the guild financially. A trade offer that satisfies all parties must be created. If this cannot be done, there will be heavy repercussions for the merchant.]</p>",
    "<p>Desir and Romantica shared a look before Romantica quickly began to control the situation.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHm? Of course we won\u2019t hand over the food for free. That\u2019s right, we\u2019re going to start negotiations.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir had a plan.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOn top of paying a large sum for the food within six months,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll let you use the name of Evernatten for your business. In other words, your guild will become a group operating within Evernatten.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cGiving us full trading rights?\u201d said Romantica, \u201cthat\u2019s not bad.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEeehh? Wait a minute guild leader,\u201d said Emil, his voice growing loud in panic, \u201care we handing over all the food just for the name of a fallen noble? In what world is that a fair trade?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica and Desir shared a sly smile at his panicked voice.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible loss for now, \u201c explained Romantica, \u201cbut Evernatten\u2019s name still holds a great deal of prestige. A noble\u2019s name is not nothing. It\u2019s a name that everyone recognizes. I\u2019ve heard that Evernatten\u2019s main source of income is supplying knights to support other regions.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWait, how do you know that much?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMost bandits wouldn\u2019t dare touch products if it is marked with the Evernatten name.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Despite Evernatten being a fallen noble, his name was still widely known.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe will be able to grow our guild several times in size within five years. Borrowing Evernatten\u2019s name with just this amount of food is a great deal for us.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Emil stood slack jawed, unable to refute Romantica\u2019s logic. Romantica turned back to Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll make our guild Evernatten\u2019s main merchant group and grant us the same rights as residents of this territory. This much should be okay, right?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir bowed with a wild flourish as if they were acting in a screenplay.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe welcome you to the Evernatten region, Miss Romantica.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica responded in kind, enjoying the acting. She pressed her lips together and did her best impression of a noblewoman.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHo ho. I leave myself in your care, Mr. Tactician.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>[Sub-quest cleared! A trade agreement has been made that satisfies both parties. With the deal complete, the region\u2019s food issues have been miraculously resolved.</p>",
    "<p>*The Vagrant issue progress has advanced greatly (Progress rate 71%)]</p>"
