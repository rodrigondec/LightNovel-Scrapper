    "<p>Desir let out a small yawn as he stretched, stiff and sore from the long hours. He glanced over at Lord Wilhelm. Unlike Desir, the lord gave no indication that he was at all tired from another long day.</p>",
    "<p>Silently, Desir continued to watch Lord Wilhelm. His diligence was unsurprising; Desir had known him to be a hard worker from the very first day. But now, he saw Wilhelm in a new light. \u2018To think, he was such a man\u2026\u2019. Indeed, Desir was certain that if the records of the Holy Nation hadn\u2019t been lost, Wilhelm\u2019s name would\u2019ve found their way into the history books.</p>",
    "<p>He swallowed his bitterness at the last thought. With the dearth of information about the Shadow World, humanity had been beaten badly over the last several centuries. Desir felt even more impressed by Wilhelm; given that half the continent was presently swallowed up, clearing a Shadow World this long ago must\u2019ve been extremely difficult. \u2018To think, he was able to perform such a feat without any prior knowledge or any modern technology. Incredible.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>And yet, despite having such a singularly talented man, the Holy Nation had still been utterly destroyed. Desir stopped himself from shaking his head. \u2018How stupid they are\u2026gone because of a stupid religious ideology.\u2019 In the modern era, what once was the Holy Nation of Artemis was a land shrouded in a dark fog; a land swallowed by a single Shadow World, with the exception of Orrane Province, where Desir\u2019s party was currently located.</p>",
    "<p>Contemporary history knew of Class 3 and below (indeed, humanity owed its current record against the Shadow Worlds partially to the fact that no Shadow Worlds of Class 1 or 2 had appeared in recent memory), but records existed of even bigger, even more dangerous Shadow Worlds. The Holy Nation had been destroyed by one, evidently: a Class 1 Shadow World.</p>",
    "<p>Desir let his thoughts wander back to the present. \u2018The Church of Artemis, huh?\u2019 While the Holy Nation had been destroyed, their religion survived, continuing to the modern Western Kingdoms. In fact, Priscilla, one of the Final Six, was a member of the Church of Artemis. \u2018But their beliefs are very different from these\u2026\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Desir\u2019s thoughts drifted again, back to Wilhelm. Although Desir\u2019s talk with Jefran had been enlightening, he had found no clues or hints for his current quest, the vagrant problem, and therefore, it was most likely irrelevant.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018So Wilhelm is a man who is infinitely devoted to his people. Although he belonged to the Church of Artemis, he put the lives of his people above his religious beliefs. He possesses a powerful military here in Evernatten, and rules it with an innovative management system.\u2019 Desir quickly went through the positive qualities of Lord Wilhelm. \u2018But something went wrong with the vagrants. So what choices did he make?\u2019</p>",
    "<p>A sharp rap on the door interrupted his thoughts. He heard the scritching of Wilhelm\u2019s pen stop. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>A female knight with sharp eyes and long hair tied tightly behind her head opened the door and stepped through. It was Eyulan. Desir\u2019s mouth tightened ever so slightly. He still vividly remembered the withering glare and harsh insults she sent his direction when he had first met her while visiting Ajest.</p>",
    "<p>She stopped in front of the lord, and kneeled in a gesture of respect. A cool, sharp voice rang out. \u201cFor the honor of Evernatten!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cRaise your head.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>She looked up at Lord Wilhelm. \u201cKnight Eyulan Lilistick greets you, my lord.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSpeak.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir noticed her eyes briefly flicker to Desir, before returning the Wilhelm. He pretended not to notice, too absorbed with paperwork.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI am here to make my monthly crime report. Captain Ajest apologizes that she is unable to appear in person. She says she is currently too busy handling other matters, and asks forgiveness.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI understand she has been working hard lately. Report back to her that it\u2019s alright if she\u2019s busy.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThank you for your understanding, my lord.\u201d From her pocket, she pulled out small stack of paper. \u201cMy lord, all the fine details are written here in this report. In the last month, we have 7 cases of murder, rape, arson, and other serious crimes, and 50 additional cases of misdemeanors.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir winced mentally. The crime rate was quite high.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cExcluding 1 serious and 12 minor offenders, the rest were vagrants.\u201d The subtext was clear. In her eyes, the vagrants were responsible. Wilhelm nodded. Eyulan continued. \u201cAnd this.\u201d She pulled another document out. \u201cThis is a public statement, a request to exile all criminals.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir couldn\u2019t stop himself from looking up. He saw the corners of Wilhelm\u2019s lips twitch, before the lord spoke. \u201cFor what purpose are you giving me this?\u201d His words had the slightest tone.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMy lord, I must deliver to you the will of the people.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Wilhelm took the documents and placed it on top of his desk. Without even glancing at them, he simply said, \u201cAs always, criminals will go through the proper legal channels, and be punished accordingly.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cForgive me, my lord, but I must speak. I believe the current measures we are taking are far too soft, and therefore ineffective. We need stronger measures.\u201d Eyulan\u2019s delivery showed her belief in her words. \u201cWhile Captain Ajest has managed to sharply reduce the number of crimes within Evernatten, she cannot change the nature of vagrants. They are ungrateful, and cause harm to our people. In particular, many crimes have been reported from the slum city they have set up.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo are you telling me to exile all the vagrants then?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNo, my lord. However, I do believe that your grace and generosity need not extend to criminals.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI will take this into consideration then. You may leave.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Eyulan lowered her head again, before turning around and leaving quietly. As she left, Wilhelm took the statement she had delivered and read through it.</p>",
    "<p>Desir sighed internally. Exile, in this winter, especially when they had nowhere else to go, would\u2019ve been no different from death.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDesir, I\u2019ve heard rumors that you\u2019ve been working on this vagrant issue.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThen you must know a lot about them. What do you think of Eyulan\u2019s suggestions?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI believe her words are reasonable.\u201d As much as Desir did not want to admit it, reworking public safety was only a half-solution. Despite everything they had done, the progression of the main quest remained stuck at 30%.</p>",
    "<p>Wilhelm paused briefly before responding. \u201cI do, however, believe it\u2019s a bit excessive to punish them so severely.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cExcessive, huh\u2026?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The lord lightly tapped the sheet of paper. \u201cEven I must acknowledge that the crime rates of the vagrants far exceed those of everyone else. While our knights are working hard on a solution, there are limits to what they can do. I believe, unfortunately, that I must take stronger measures.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a quick demonstration, that my grace and generosity have limits. I have accepted these vagrants into Evernatten, and I believe that in return they should show some respect. I cannot let my people continue to suffer because of my selfishness.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>It pained Desir to admit, but Wilhelm was not wrong at all. \u201cIf you will do so, consider deporting those with a death penalty. I believe it would set a sufficient example.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI was planning on doing so.\u201d The lord spoke, with a sudden conviction.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018What!?\u2019 As soon as he finished speaking, an announcement had rang out. It was all Desir could do to hide his panic. He had thought, if the vagrants were responsible for Evernatten\u2019s problems, one possible solution would be simply to remove them. While he was personally opposed to this approach, he had to admit that it would likely work. However, as soon as he suggested exile, the quest progression had actually declined, which could only mean one thing.</p>",
    "<p>Removing the vagrants was not the solution. He was following a path opposite to clearing the Shadow World. That meant that Wilhelm must have chosen to exile the vagrants in the past.</p>",
    "<p>[It is a time of chaos. In such troubling times, the people have cried out for a hero, and they have been led to the Unique Hero: Wilhelm Evernatten. He accomplished many incredible feats, earning the nickname \u2018Saladin.\u2019]</p>",
    "<p>[But that was history. His title of Cardinal has been long forgotten, and his loyal knights long disbanded.]</p>",
    "<p>[The Fallen Hero, Wilhelm Evernatten. All he had left was his hometown and a fragment of his old blazing conviction. When he returned to Evernatten, he hoped to protect his territory from the barbarians, and accepted all vagrants, out of compassion for the people.]</p>",
    "<p>[Alas, reality would not accommodate his noble ideals of protecting everyone. At times, one must sacrifice the few to save the many. And so, as ruler of Evernatten, he made up his mind.]</p>",
    "<p>[But his decision did not address the root problem.]</p>",
    "<p>Ideals. Conviction. Barbarians and vagrants. It all began coming together for Desir.</p>",
    "<p>Wilhelm Evernatten: the lord who lived for his people. He accepted any and all vagrants, but problems of public order & food stocks arose from his decision.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Historically, he must have not known about the barbarian invasion either\u2026\u2019 Desir had discovered the barbarians\u2019 plans, and taken appropriate countermeasures, because he was familiar with their habits and mindset. But in the real history, Wilhelm must\u2019ve been blindsided by the attack. Bloody Falcon Claw would have stolen what he wanted and burned down the rest, exactly as planned, which meant that the barbarians would have re-initiated their war with Evernatten, which would have required the whole military of Evernatten to fight against the barbarians.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018With no food and no knights available, the vagrant problem would\u2019ve been impossible to deal with.\u2019 It all made sense now. The cruel reality would\u2019ve become apparent to Lord Wilhelm: his ideals were merely illusions. He would\u2019ve abandoned what remained of his pride, by abandoning the vagrants.</p>"
