    "<p>By the time Romantica\u2019s efforts began to bear fruit, a full week had passed. \u2018This time, I\u2019ll do it!\u2019 Romantica focused on the can in front of her eyes. Atmospheric pressure wasn\u2019t easy to control with magic, let alone using it to compress a can into a smooth sphere.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018I think I know why Desir told me to do this.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Romantica had been training for an entire week, and she had failed countless times because she was lacking in fundamentals\u2014 controlling her mana intensity and minute manipulation. As she became more familiar with the process of making the sphere, she gained a clearer understanding of how important it was to master these skills.</p>",
    "<p>With a crunch, the can in her hand crumpled and started to condense into a single point. \u2018This is enough. I just have to keep this up!\u2019 Romantica focused with renewed vigor, and the can continued its rate of compression. There was a bit of variance in its speed\u2014 sometimes a hint faster or slower, but it was largely steady.</p>",
    "<p>After about 10 seconds, the can went from its original cylindrical shape into a perfect sphere. Romantica broke out into a smile. \u201cLook! I did it!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir applauded at Romantica\u2019s achievements. \u201cAmazing.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHmph. Something like this is just the basics for somebody like me.\u201d Romantica crossed her arms and sneered at Desir. Her overconfidence was justified\u2014 the mana manipulation that she displayed was incredible progress. \u201cSo\u2026 training is over, right?\u201d Her eyes shined in anticipation as she waited for permission to leave from Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNope. The goal of training is for you to build the third circle. We\u2019ll take a short break and then go for it.\u201d Desir turned around and motioned towards the exit.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that too sudden? It\u2019s not so easy to get to the third circle.\u201d Romantica looked unconvinced.</p>",
    "<p>Desir smiled. \u201cI can help you with the finer details. There won\u2019t be any issues.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHow is that even possible?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI have confidence in mana manipulation. So long as you\u2019re okay with it, I can use your mana to build the third circle\u2014with your permission, of course.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWell, I suppose there is no reason for me to refuse.\u201d Romantica nodded in approval at Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026Ah. We may not be on the same page. Reaching the third circle requires very fine tuning, and in order to accomplish that level of precision, we\u2019ll need direct contact. For that to happen, I\u2019ll need to touch\u2014\u201c</p>",
    "<p>\u201cTouch where?!\u201d She flinched back, covering her chest. She immediately recalled that the circle was located at the centre of the body\u2019s cardiovascular system\u2014the heart. Romantica\u2019s face immedately grew hot as she pointed her finger accusatorily at Desir. \u201cShameless!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m asking for consent beforehand! It\u2019s something that has to be done in order to build the third circle.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWha\u2014you think this is the sort of thing you can fix with consent? That\u2019s just an excuse, you creep!\u201d Romantica bore her teeth at Desir\u2019s approaching hand. He pulled his hand back to show that he had no intention of doing what she was insinuating.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy, but in order to build the third circle\u2026\u201d Desir gestured towards a certain part of Romantica\u2019s body.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica stared dumbly at him. \u201cThe back?\u201d The other end of a person\u2019s heart and stomach. Whilst unpleasant to show a bare back to others, the alternative was far worse. \u201cWell, if that\u2019s the case\u2026 The back, huh\u2026 I guess that wouldn\u2019t really be an issue.\u201d Her face was downcast, with her face still blushing.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you adamantly against it just a second ago? Why the sudden change of heart? Did you misunderstand that I was talking about, and you thought I was referring to th\u2014\u201c</p>",
    "<p>\u201cShut up! I don\u2019t know! Stupid!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>He paused for a moment before giving her a nod. \u201cIt sounds like you did, but that\u2019s perfectly understandable.\u201d Desir snidely chuckled. \u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s not completely impossible to go from the front. If you really want to\u2014should we do it from the front?</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDon\u2019t make such a perverted request! You did it on purpose, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Her eyes glared reproachfully at Desir.</p>",
    "<p>In any case, they eventually reached an agreement on the construction of Romantica\u2019s third circle. Once Romantica had a moment to recover, they would begin preparations to start.</p>",
    "<p>All of the entrances were locked, curtains were closed, and all of the lights were extinguished. Romantica slowly loosened her dress and uncovered her torso, before covering her front and putting her back toward Desir. She could feel the warmth from Desir as he laid her hands on her back.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll get started, Romantica.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica trembled at his touch, and frowned before looking back at Desir. \u201cDo you think I can do it?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou have plenty of mana to reach the third circle. You just don\u2019t know how to do it yet. Just close your eyes and focus. Take a deep breath\u2014good. Now start circulating your mana.\u201d Romantica was calm, and as she let all of her tension fall away, her mana began to circulate through her circles one by one.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cGood. Now slowly draw out your mana.\u201d Romantica obediently followed his orders, and pure mana began to exude from her second circle.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt feels like it\u2019s going to dissipate!\u201d Romantica\u2019s face was fraught with worry at the thought.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014I\u2019ll keep it steady. Don\u2019t be scared, and bring out all of the mana that you need.\u201d Desir caught a hold of her mana and held it together. In the meantime, Romantica brought out all of the mana needed for Desir to form the third circle. \u201cNow slowly circulate it into the form of a circle.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>A soft sound emanated from the mana as it rotated and formed the circle. \u201cJust like making the can into a sphere,\u201d said Desir as he coaxed the mana out of Romantica.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI know,\u201d said Romantica. As evidence that her training didn\u2019t go to waste, Romantica brilliantly morphed her mana to wrap around the circle in a sphere. Romantica grit her teeth\u2014the mana control she was exhibiting was taking its toll on her, and she was sweating profusely. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNow, we\u2019re going to start on the smaller details. Maintain the sphere and I will focus on the task.\u201d Desir began to move the mana from within her body. He refined the mana condensed into the sphere by separating them into section and carving them, then rotating the sculpted mana. As the thousands of small spheres of mana began to rotate, the circle overheated.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cArgh! It hurts!\u201d yelped Romantica.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou have to endure!\u201d responded Desir. It was a very fine process\u2014 mana had to be sculpted a precise form and then rotated one-by-one. As the rotating mana began to gain momentum, it would pull the surrounding mana towards itself.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018The source mana.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>This resource, so long as it wasn\u2019t consumed past a certain point, would recover by itself. This mana needed to reach an optimum size. If it was too small, the magic produced would be weaker. If it was too large, the source mana needed to maintain the container of mana would crumble. \u2018I can\u2019t get this wrong\u2014 there is no margin for error.\u2019 Desir had to calculate the outer limits of her source mana, and use that to create the foundation of her third circle.</p>",
    "<p>As the engine was formed, the pain would drastically increase. Romantica did her best to endure, but cries of pain leaked from her lips. Despite all of this, Romantica did not falter. She endured purely with her force of will. Desir, however, became hurried as he continued work amidst her screams. As they worked, Romantica\u2019s breathing became labored. Desir bit his lip and he endeavored to work faster. He had to stack each ring of mana perfectly.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAny more is too much\u2026\u201d Romantica practically coughed out the words to Desir. Her focus was hazy, and the binding force of the mana became weaker. She was on the cusp of blackout.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEndure.\u201d Desir knew there was nothing else he could tell her. As time passed on, Desir\u2019s responsibility grew weightier as he had to maintain the mana\u2019s form, but had to pick up speed once more. He materialized the entirety of her mana and began to form the circle. With out any other options in front of him, he had to to complete the task before Romantica reached her limits.</p>",
    "<p>The third circle expanded at a furious pace, and\u2014</p>",
    "<p>Thud.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica collapsed like a rock, and her limbs quivered in time with her ragged breath. She wanted to cover herself up, as her back was in full view of Desir, but she couldn\u2019t muster the energy. All Romantica could do was close her eyes, as she focused on her breathing. Desir, likewise, fell back onto the floor.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe did it.\u201d</p>"
