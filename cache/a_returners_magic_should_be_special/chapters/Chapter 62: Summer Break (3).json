    "<p>The sound of the train travelling over its tracks filled the air. Beautiful scenery passed by endlessly beyond the hallway window. Staring out the window, it was hard to tell whether the train was moving, or if it was the world moving around them.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe\u2019re starting to move,\u201d said Pram as he entered the passenger room at the end of the train. Desir\u2019s party could only start their journey four days after Romantica left as the procedure required to obtain the entry permits into the Prilecha Kingdom was considerably arduous.</p>",
    "<p>Because of the Shadow World, the Western Kingdom Alliance and Hebrion Kingdom had formed a peace treaty in order to survive. As such, citizens of both nations could freely move between the two countries, but obtaining an entry permit was still quite a finicky and time consuming process.</p>",
    "<p>The Outers. As long as this criminal group existed, scattered across the continent, each country had to take the traveller screening process seriously.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get there in three days, so rest up,\u201d said Desir. Hearing this, Pram looked around excitedly while Ajest pulled out a book and began reading. Desir was planning to review his own plans for the future during the trip. The superficial reason he had given the party for this trip to the Prilecha Kingdom was the Golden Ocean Tournament. However, that was only an excuse. His true purpose was the Western Kingdom Alliance\u2019s Grand Council meeting.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018My real reason for visiting the Prilecha Kingdom is the Grand Council Meeting for the Western Kingdom Alliance.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>The most important figures from the most influential groups within the five kingdoms that formed the Alliance will be participating in this meeting and, thanks to Zod, Desir was allowed to attend as Zod\u2019s companion and as a member of the Magic Tower.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Priscilla\u2026she will be a great help.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Priscilla Hysilkite. Priscilla obtained the title \u201cImmaculate Saintess\u201d with her ability to handle magic beyond the realm of the modern magic system and had become influential enough to be referred to as the sixth \u2018King\u2019 of the alliance. It was because of this influence that she participated in the Grand Council, attending as the head of the Church of Artemis.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018The power of the Western Kingdom Alliance is also needed to prepare for the Shadow Labyrinth.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Before the Shadow Labyrinth itself appeared, there had been several omens that were continuously ignored by humanity. In the end, they couldn\u2019t properly gather their forces before the Shadow Labyrinth was upon them.</p>",
    "<p>By the time the Alliance and the Hebrion Kingdom managed to form a unified army to stand against the worst Shadow World in history, it was much too late. Ultimately, each nation gathered their most powerful people and they sent out an army of over 100 million. However, even when faced with such a calamity, the two nations had such a tumultuous history that they found it impossible to work together and had to split their forces. In this state, it was impossible to stand against the worst of all Shadow Worlds.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018At that time as well\u2026\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Desir could see the scenes from his nightmare flash before his eyes. He had experienced countless nightmarish situations in his past life and each moment was etched deeply upon his heart, resulting in an overwhelming feeling of melancholy that he could barely contain.</p>",
    "<p>Desir was lost deep in his thoughts when someone knocked on the door. Desir looked towards the door.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cExcuse me. I\u2019m travelling alone. Do you mind if I sit here?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The person who entered through the door was a silver-haired old man. His wrinkles left a strong impression of the many years that he must have experienced. Pram and Ajest reacted to the request. Ajest barely looked up from her book, but nodded in consent. Pram agreed as well.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cCome on in.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cPardon the intrusion.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The old man entered the passenger room. As it was designed for four passengers, the room didn\u2019t feel cramped. The old man looked over his new travel companions carefully.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI hope I\u2019m not interrupting something.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSuch a polite young man. I\u2019m Dmitri. Are you all students from the Hebrion Academy?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAh yes. I am a student from the Hebrion Academy. My name is Desir Arman.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAh, I didn\u2019t recognize such a celebrity! I had wanted to meet you, but I didn\u2019t expect it to be like this.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Dmitri recognized Desir\u2019s name and held out his hand, his expression still locked in surprise. Desir clasped the man\u2019s hand awkwardly, but Dmitri shook it enthusiastically.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou know me?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Your name is quite famous. Didn\u2019t you cut the aristocracy down a peg as a commoner?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir immediately understood.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bit of an exaggeration.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not exaggerated at all! Is it so easy for a commoner to become a Single Ranker at Hebrion Academy, a school dominated by nobles? I\u2019m well aware of the situation, since my own children are attending that school as well.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAh, haha.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHonestly, there were many doubts when you passed the Promotional Exam. People were saying that you used some trickery or that you bribed some of the teachers. Of course, I believe in you all the way, but you really proved your skills by clearing that fourth rank Shadow World! You all have shown us commoners that we can do it as well. You proved that we are no worse than those noble bastards.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Dmitri was still holding onto Desir\u2019s hand and showed no intention of letting go. It was a small thing. A small step towards showing that commoners can also make something of themselves. Even so, Desir relished the feeling of this personal goal of his progressing as he intended.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAh, this old man is embarrassing you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Dmitri let go of Desir\u2019s hand and began to laugh awkwardly. As he did so, he took closer note of the others in the passenger room.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNow that I look at it, these are all your party members.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right sir.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cPlease clear the Shadow World next year as well. I leave it to you.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>They travelled with Dmitri about halfway to the Prilecha Kingdom before the old man disembarked. Dmitri said a brief farewell as he got off. Desir\u2019s party arrived at their own destination the day after.</p>",
    "<p>Thanks to Zod\u2019s referral, the border crossing was quick. As they left the station, the first thing they noticed were the thousands of lampposts lighting the wide highway that stretched as far as the eye could see. Fancy buildings lined this great highway, all closely packed in together. This was the capital of the Prilecha Kingdom, the city of commerce and prosperity, Deltaheim.</p>",
    "<p>From the liveliness everywhere, it was easy to see why the Prilecha Kingdom was called the great nation of economy. There were roads connecting every city within the Prilecha Kingdom and the capital, Deltaheim, had the ocean directly to its east. All exports from the Alliance were sent out to the rest of the world through this ocean. Deltaheim\u2019s pride wasn\u2019t its fancy buildings or highly organized network of roads, but this ocean.</p>",
    "<p>As the sun set, the ocean glittered with a golden hue, as if reflecting the wealth of Deltaheim. The Golden Ocean Tournament originally started as a tribute to this ocean. Desir\u2019s party was mesmerized by the sights and sounds of Deltaheim. It took a while before they noticed a well-dressed man holding a sign that read: Desir Arman. Desir\u2019s jaw dropped.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt looks like Sir Desir\u2019s name has even spread to this far away land,\u201d said Pram, sounding like he was growing tired of fame, \u201cit\u2019s almost scary at this point. Could it be that the entire continent knows your name?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir gulped. He dared to hope that was the reason for a moment before returning to reality and refuting Pram\u2019s statement.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be true. The old man from the train only knew me because his children were attending Hebrion Academy. This time\u2026there must be a reason as well.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHow about we go and ask then?\u201d suggested Ajest.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe should, right?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The man looked at Desir as the party approached him.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAre you Mister Arman?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir glanced down at the sign, but the man put it away and bowed.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI am from the Eru Trading Group. The esteemed Miss Romantica has requested your group to her residence.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>They had planned on visiting Romantica, but definitely not in this fashion.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018That\u2019s right\u2026the Eru Trading Group is a massive trading firm.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMiss Romantica is actually quite wealthy huh?\u201d muttered Pram, only now registering the fact. They often forgot about Romantica\u2019s background because she was quite expressive, unlike most women from wealthy families.</p>",
    "<p>They got on the wagon prepared by the Eru Trading Group and arrived by evening time. Romantica\u2019s home was a residence with a great view of the ocean. When the bell was rung, Romantica popped out of the house. She was wearing a frilly feminine dress. She greeted Pram brightly and barely acknowledged Ajest. Of course, Ajest didn\u2019t mind it at all. Finally, Romantica turned to Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t late.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI did promise. I don\u2019t break my promises.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo you say. You haven\u2019t eaten yet right? I\u2019ll get dinner prepared, so wash up and wait. You can head to your room and put your luggage away, I\u2019ll let the servants know.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe can just go in like this? Don\u2019t we have to greet your parents too?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s late, so you can do that next time. It\u2019s only me and a few servants here right now anyways.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis is a vacation house. They\u2019re at our main home somewhere else.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u2018This is a vacation house?\u2019 Desir suppressed his shock. Romantica was definitely cut from a different cloth.</p>",
    "<p>Desir\u2019s party entered their rooms and began putting away their luggage. They ate a nicely prepared dinner and gathered together in the living room for dessert. The view of the ocean at night was quite beautiful. As they enjoyed this relaxing moment, Romantica spoke up.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI registered us for the Golden Ocean Tournament ahead of time, just in case. Now we just have to wait six days for the tournament to start.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIs that so? We have more time to train ourselves then.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Training. Romantica\u2019s face sagged upon hearing the word. She quickly recovered and layered on the charm as she addressed Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHey Desir, we\u2019ve trained very hard up until now right? We cleared the Shadow World successfully and it\u2019s summer break now\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram, who was watching the exchange, put in his own two cents.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Sir Desir. When would we get to come here again?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cRight, right. You haven\u2019t noticed because you arrived so late in the evening, but the ocean\u2019s golden hue is quite a sight.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t just one day ok?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>It was a Pram and Romantica combined assault. Desir looked over to Ajest.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAjest, what do you think we should do?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s the responsibility of the party leader to consider his member\u2019s desire for recreation.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHm, is that so\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir considered it for a while before letting out a sigh.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018I did push them pretty hard before the break\u2026I need to give them some kind of reward if I want to push them again.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Since there were more than a few days before the tournament, he decided to relent to Romantica\u2019s request.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOk, just one day.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYahoo!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe did it!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram and Romantica high-fived while Desir gazed silent out the window. The faint sound of starlit waves crashing against the beach tickled his ears.</p>"
