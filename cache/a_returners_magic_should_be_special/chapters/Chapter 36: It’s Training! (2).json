    "<p>July 11th. 10 days before the Shadow World event.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m dead tired!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica\u2019s outburst could be heard from outside of the Hebrion Academy cafeteria, where they had just finished dinner. The food they just enjoyed was one which the Beta Class meals couldn\u2019t even begin to compare. Yet, Romantica was still upset.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cTraining. Training. Training! Are you trying to kill us?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you being a bit overdramatic? I\u2019m giving you plenty of rest,\u201d replied Desir, \u201c10 minute run, then 1 minute break, then run for another 15 minutes, then rest for 5 more minutes. The regiment is perfectly tuned.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about rest,\u201d moaned Romantica, \u201cI\u2019m talking about recreation! I want to go shopping, eat desserts, or go somewhere interesting!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica had a valid point. The group hadn\u2019t had a moment\u2019s respite since they started training three days ago. Every day, immediately after class, they would go into training or endure whatever exercise Desir had concocted that day. For a young girl of 16 years, it was unbearable.</p>",
    "<p>Desir truly felt bad about it, but he wasn\u2019t going to change anything.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018There isn\u2019t much time until we go into the Shadow World.\u2019 Of course Desir couldn\u2019t say that, so he offered a compromise, \u201cJust endure it for a little longer. Once we address our weaknesses, I\u2019ll definitely make sure we get a proper break.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>For the next few minutes, Romantica pressed for more reassurances, making Desir double and triple swear.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMiss Ajest!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhy do you want to sit with those people?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Different outbursts were heard around the cafeteria, trailing after someone who was heading in their direction. It was Ajest Kingscrown. With her platinum gold hair contrasting glamorously against her all-black uniform, she placed her food tray next to Desir\u2019s.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cStrange, there is no one sitting near your party,\u201d said Ajest.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe\u2019re commoners,\u201d replied Desir, \u201cthat stigma didn\u2019t seem to disappear just because we became Rankers.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe\u2019re still trying though, as you can see.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The fact that a commoner like Desir managed to become a Single Ranker had gained him quite a bit of reverence among the Beta Class, but the behavior of the Alpha Class was largely unchanged. As if to acknowledge this fact, Ajest nodded.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIn any case, what brings you here?\u201d said Romantica with a cautious, hushed voice.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI-it\u2019s not like I have a problem with you sitting beside Desir, it\u2019s all the attention you\u2019re attracting! Everyone is staring, good luck eating under the spotlight!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI am sorry about that, but what can I do about it?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEasy. Go to another table.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cRomantica!\u201d Despite Desir\u2019s scolding, Romantica did not rescind her comment.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDesir! Did you forget what she did to our party?\u201d Romantica could not forget that Professor Nifleka had intentionally withheld information about the Magic Tower sponsorship from them.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll go elsewhere,\u201d conceded Ajest, \u201cHowever, I do have something to say to you Desir\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest let her words linger while glancing over to see Romantica\u2019s reaction. Romantica was glaring back at her openly, already hostile towards whatever she might say. In this powderkeg situation, Ajest\u2019s next words were like striking an entire box of matches simultaneously.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDesir, can I visit your room after you finish eating? That way, we can speak alone without attracting undesirable attention from people who dislike me.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>***</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit shabby, but come in.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir\u2019s room was well organized, unlike the rooms of similar boys his age. Ajest entered and sat on a wooden chair in the guest room. The wooden backrest felt stiff, but not enough to be uncomfortable.</p>",
    "<p>Desir opened the windows to let fresh air in before heading into the kitchen. After a brief moment, he re-emerged from the kitchen with two cups of tea. Faint lines of steam rose from the reddish liquid in the cups.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis is tea made from something called plums.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat a pleasant aroma.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>It was Pram\u2019s recipe. As the pair enjoyed the fragrant tea, light from the setting sun pierced through the open window. The room was filled with a color similar to the tea that they were drinking. The midsummer breeze swept into the room, providing a pleasant cooling sensation.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhy did you have to phrase your request in a way that is easily misunderstood?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat about it? It wasn\u2019t a complete lie.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf you put it that way, I guess there\u2019s nothing more I can say\u2026\u201d Desir relented and switched topics.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo, what did you want to speak to me about?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI have a question. Could you answer it for me?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI can answer to the best of my ability.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest lowered her teacup. \u201cHow did you apply the Grease spell to a three-dimensional surface?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo you were curious about that.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest was referring back to the Entrance Exam, when Desir applied Grease onto his body. It appeared simple, but that wasn\u2019t the case in reality. Grease was a type of field magic that couldn\u2019t be manipulated. Rather, the spell enveloped whatever surface it was casted upon. It was simple to cast Grease onto a flat surface, but it was almost impossible to cast it perfectly onto an irregular shape. This is why Grease is most commonly used on the floor.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cCan you teach me?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThere is nothing stopping me.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir stood up and produced two sheets of paper from a nearby shelf and laid one flat on the table.</p>",
    "<p>[Grease]</p>",
    "<p>After casting the spell onto the paper, Desir flicked it with his finger, causing the paper to slide smoothly off the table. The paper continued on, beyond the door and into the living room.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis is how Grease is normally used.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest nodded, having known this already. Desir continued, placing the second sheet of paper onto the table. This time, after casting Grease onto the paper, he lifted it into the air. Ajest observed with curiosity in her eyes. She watched as Desir held the two top corners of the paper and began slowly ripping them apart. He continued to tear the paper apart until he was left with pieces no bigger than her fingernail. With the paper fully shredded, Desir dipped his thumb in his tea and used the moisture to adhere the pieces of ripped paper to his teacup. Once he was satisfied, he tapped the cup, causing it to slide smoothly across the table before stopping in front of Ajest.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis is the answer you are looking for.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou break down the three-dimensional surface into polygons and calculate each polygon separately?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest understood the theory almost immediately.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Just so you know, the hexagon is the most convenient shape to use. What you have to be cautious of is\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest suddenly rose from her seat and casted a spell.</p>",
    "<p>[Grease]</p>",
    "<p>Just as Desir had shown her, Ajest calculated polygons to cover her body. Doing so required several times more effort than casting the basic form of the spell. Grease enveloped her like a piece of clothing. Ajest tested moving her foot. It moved as though it faced no air resistance. It also felt awkward. Her body\u2019s movement and sensations had changed. Ajest felt like she wasn\u2019t quite in her own body. It was because movement had become too easy and, despite being an outstanding fighter, she could not maintain her balance. She tried to use her other foot to counterbalance, but it was a mistake to move at all. Her entire body tilted, causing her center of balance to shift\u2026</p>",
    "<p>Ajest landed with a loud thud. She thought briefly that the floor was strangely soft but, when she opened her eyes, she saw that Desir had acted swiftly to catch her after noticing that she was falling.</p>",
    "<p>His eyes met hers as he gently chided, \u201cWhat you have to be cautious of is the change in sensation as friction will no longer apply as normal.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cApparently. It means that training is needed.\u201d Ajest nodded understandingly. She then noticed that Desir\u2019s cheeks were flushed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Desir, are you hurt anywhere?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just that\u2026,\u201d Ajest tilted her head quizzically as Desir found his words, \u201ccan you stand now?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The pair were in a strange position. Ajest was on top of Desir, who had his arms securely wrapped around her waist in order to prevent her fall. Ajest gave a sly smile. Instead of moving off, she pressed down on Desir\u2019s body with her thumb.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAjest?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>While in this compromising position, Ajest announced something with a voice of indifference, as if what she was saying had nothing to do with her.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI left the Blue Moon Party.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNo, wait!\u201d Desir immediately stood up.</p>",
    "<p>What did I just hear?\u2019 There was an uneasy feeling in his heart. Desir closed his eyes and gathered his thoughts. He then calmly repeated what Ajest said.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAre you telling me that you\u2019re not in the Blue Moon Party anymore?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I can\u2019t stand being with that kind of a Professor\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The sun had long since set and the room was filled with darkness, but Desir didn\u2019t even noticed. Ajest\u2019s words half-confirmed the uneasy feeling, causing it weigh heavily on his chest like a lead weight.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou\u2026discovered what happened. Is that why you left the party?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThere is no need for you to get worked up Desir. It was a personal\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAnswer me, Ajest.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s say that\u2019s the case for now.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir bit his lip, drawing some blood. \u2018Did the timeline change this much?\u2019</p>",
    "<p>By walking a different path than he did in the past, Desir was expecting to see differences in the timeline, but this was unprecedented.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018I changed someone\u2019s life.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>In Desir\u2019s original timeline, Ajest was the ace of the Blue Moon Party. Even in the Shadow Labyrinth, she participated as their member. Desir\u2019s actions had caused that ace to leave the party!</p>",
    "<p>\u2018It\u2019s my fault\u2026\u2019</p>",
    "<p>A lot of things had changed since Desir had become a Single Ranker. While Ajest leaving her party could not be traced back to him, Desir knew that his actions directly resulted in Ajest\u2019s withdrawal.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018How did i not foresee this?\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Desir re-analyzed his actions several times in his head and knew that he had caused this change in the timeline.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ajest.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhy are you sorry?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest did not understand. She couldn\u2019t understand, but Desir felt a great remorse. He felt responsible for the situation and a desire to make things right.</p>",
    "<p>There was an audible click as Ajest found a lantern. Instantly, the dark room was illuminated.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cLook at me Desir,\u201d Ajest pointed to her eyes, her face clearly visible, \u201cdo I look sad? Do you see any resentment towards you? If not, then you don\u2019t have a reason to feel sorry for me. It\u2019s that simple. You are a victim here. I was only able to see the Professor\u2019s true personality because of you. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest guided Desir to a chair.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come to you to make you feel uncomfortable around me,\u201d Ajest followed Desir\u2019s gaze to the paper on the floor and gave an uncharacteristic chuckle, \u201cof course, one of the reasons was to ask you about something that I couldn\u2019t figure out.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest leaned forward, the light of the lantern reflected in her eyes.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI believe a party must be righteous. When in a competition, a party must overcome their opponent, not with underhanded schemes, but through skill. And after doing so, they must remain humble. When I think about the parties that meet this criteria, there was only one that came to mind.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAjest, you\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDesir, will you accept me into your party?\u201d</p>"
