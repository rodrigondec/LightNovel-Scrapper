    "<p>And with that, their train-every-day schedule began.</p>",
    "<p>Each morning, at 6 o\u2019clock, they would wake up to train. Once they finished their morning training, they\u2019d immediately head off to class; they wouldn\u2019t forego classes just because of their training (in fact, from Desir\u2019s perspective, acquiring knowledge was training in and of itself). This carried on for a number of weeks, until -</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna die! Please, let us skip the evening training, I\u2019m begging you!\u201d Romantica protested. She felt exhausted from the workload, but Desir was relentless.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNo, sorry.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>It was futile.</p>",
    "<p>Evening training began after their classes ended. Unlike the morning sessions, which were a form of basic training, the evening sessions were a more personalized training, specifically tailored to Pram and Romantica. They trained separately, and Desir would teach both of them individually.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica\u2019s personal training sessions began in the Alpha Class\u2019s wind mage training grounds. The roof had been left open that evening, leaving the clouds in full view.</p>",
    "<p>Desir opened the session with a simple question, one that any mage could answer. \u201cWhat would you say are the characteristics of a wind mage?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cTheir casting speed is extremely quick, and their magic has good range,\u201d Romantica answered.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cCorrect,\u201d said Desir, nodding. \u201cThis is why wind mages make better snipers than any other type of mage. Their sniping ability is irreplaceable.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBut, like I said, there\u2019s a limit to your impact as a 2nd circle mage. You should have realized this yourself, correct?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Reluctantly, Romantica nodded in agreement. As she had quickly discovered, she was, truthfully, excruciatingly weak. Her sniping spells, paired with chantless casting, were indeed remarkable, but no amount of speed and surprise could make up for her lack of power. Her sniping had been rendered totally useless as soon as that 4th circle mage had appeared, leaving her unable to do anything but watch.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou need to become a 3rd circle mage,\u201d stated Desir simply. \u201cMoreover, you need to strengthen the power of your attack to the point that you can penetrate 4th circle defensive magic at the very least.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWha-? 4th circle?\u201d Romantica nearly fell backwards in shock. A 4th circle mage was a high mage: they numbered only in the hundreds, across the entire continent. She quickly began arguing back. \u201cHey, I\u2019m telling you, achieving 3rd circle isn\u2019t that easy! You have to cast countless spells and slowly perfect your fine control over your mana, until you can perfect your 2nd circle techniques, and then -\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir cut her off before she could finish. \u201cSure, that\u2019s the normal way to reach 3rd circle. I\u2019m gonna teach you a different method.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach you a shortcut to reach 3rd circle in a very short amount of time.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026I\u2019m surprised you know of such a method. You\u2019re only a 1st circle mage.\u201d By now, Romantica had moved past bewilderment and was solidly annoyed. Everything he said was utterly absurd.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not going to do it?\u201d asked Desir innocently.</p>",
    "<p>She almost sighed before she answered. \u201cNo, I will.\u201d At the end of the day, Romantica believed in Desir with all her heart. If he said it was possible, it was possible.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cGood. Let\u2019s start with this.\u201d He smiled as he pulled an empty coke can out of his bag, and placed it on his palm.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this for?\u201d Romantica had returned to being puzzled.</p>",
    "<p>Instead of responding, Desir simply drew a deep breath, and began exerting his mana. The can wobbled, then, with a series of slow crunches, the can began crumpling in around itself.</p>",
    "<p>It wasn\u2019t quick, or haphazard, like crushing a can between your bare hands. It felt almost methodical, deliberate. The corners of the can caved in bit by bit, and the center bent in on itself like a bow, slowly, tensely. The edges folded in neatly, and then - with one last loud crunch - the can neatly collapsed into a small marble, which fell into Desir\u2019s palm.</p>",
    "<p>He handed the marble to Romantica nonchalantly, and explained, \u201cit\u2019s similar to the ball movement training we did before; an upgraded version, perhaps. The difference is, instead of simply knocking the ball away, you have to carefully control the atmospheric pressure to compress the can into a sphere. Simple, right?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica looked at him, dazed. \u2018What is this crazy bastard asking?\u2019 In the basic sense, controlling atmospheric pressure wasn\u2019t difficult at all. She simply had to control the density of the air locally. But that was really limited to creating pressure differentials; utilizing those pressure differentials to form a perfect sphere was an entirely different question. She couldn\u2019t even begin to fathom how he precisely he had to have controlled the air density around the can to do such a thing.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAlright, why don\u2019t you give it a shot.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica looked at Desir\u2019s smiling face and sighed. \u2018What an absolute bastard\u2026\u2019 It was going to incredibly difficult, but what could she do? Desir told her to do it as a teacher, so she had to listen as a student.</p>",
    "<p>She stared at the can intensely, and began releasing her mana, concentrating on maintaining perfect control. \u2018Adjust the atmospheric pressure. Adjust the air density. Lower inside, high around the corners to bend them. Compress into a sphere\u2026\u2019</p>",
    "<p>The can began crumpling noisily, as the corners bent in on themselves and the center collapsed. Slowly but surely, as she carefully worked the air density around the can, she saw it take on the circular shape Desir had produced.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018It\u2019s working!\u2019 She was almost giddy, and, perhaps because she allowed herself this momentary celebration, the concentration she had worked so hard to hold collapsed, and the air began flowing violently in one direction. In an instant, the can flattened under the pressure, collapsing into the shape of a saucer.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOooh\u2026\u201d Romantica felt her cheeks flush with embarrassment, as she stared at the ruined can.</p>",
    "<p>Smiling, Desir came over and took the can out of her hands. \u201cI\u2019m asking just in case but -\u201d he had a slightly mischevious smile as he waved the can in front of her. \u201cYou know the difference between a circle and a sphere right?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be doing combat training.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The sweltering evening heat bore down upon Desir and Pram. For Pram, his personal training would be in the drill hall, where students dueled each other to measure their own abilities.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cPram, your strength is your overwhelming speed, and the terrifying power that comes with that speed,\u201d Desir explained. \u201cBut, at the moment, you\u2019re still weak in handling a lot of different kinds of situations; you\u2019re inexperienced. The best way to gain experience is by fighting.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cFighting? If it\u2019s another Knight-rank\u2026is it Percival?\u201d Pram had fought Percival before, in the ranking tournament. They had been quite evenly matched as fellow Knight-ranks. Pram felt that he would make a good opponent.</p>",
    "<p>But Desir shook his head. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly gain experience from a Knight-rank. Instead, we have someone even better.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram followed Desir\u2019s eyes and turned around. He saw a man, in his mid-thirties, with graying hair. He wore a longsword at his hip.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis is Mr. Kayrach,\u201d Desir introduced. \u201c2nd circle mage and Knight-rank. A high-level spellsword. He\u2019s the head of security at the Tower of Magic\u2019s Aeurelli branch.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe Tower of Magic\u2026is this also part of their support? Like the credit card?\u201d asked Pram.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cCorrect. I invited him over to train you.\u201d As the head of security, he was a difficult man to get a hold of. Kayrach stroked his beard in amusement at his opponent.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHm\u2014 this little girl is to be my opponent? It isn\u2019t going to be much of a fight,\u201d said Kayrach.</p>",
    "<p>Pram\u2019s smile creased at his words. \u201cAre you judging your opponent based on appearance alone?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>At the sound of Pram\u2019s outburst, Kayrach\u2019s look of bemusement fell from his face. \u201cOh. You\u2019re a guy? Your arms and legs were so thin I couldn\u2019t tell. My deepest apologies.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram trembled at Kayrach\u2019s words. He clenched his training sword and looked ready to shatter it in his hands. Turning towards Desir, he asked for permission to begin. \u201cCan we start immediately?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>On cue, Desir nodded, but not before offering a small object to the two competitors. \u201cBefore that, please put this on.\u201d It was a lapel to be worn on their shoulder. \u201cThis lapel has been embedded with alarm magic. The moment the training sword makes contact with your body, the alarm will go off. The rules are simple enough: the person whose lapel goes off, loses.\u201d Desir paused before adding on, \u201cAh. And don\u2019t worry about ties. After one has gone off, the other won\u2019t activate.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d asked Pram.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. If you can get it to go off even once, the training is over.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Kayrach broke into a smile as he sized up his opponent. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad that\u2019s never going to happen.\u201d He then tapped his sword against the ground, daring the boy to try his best.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d He glowered his eyes at his opponent.</p>",
    "<p>Pram closed his eyes and took a deep breath. The atmosphere surrounding him changed, and he was no longer as carefree as he was before. This was Pram, ready for battle.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018He\u2019s good at provoking his opponent,\u2019 thought Desir. He looked at the two swordsmen, stepped back, and opened his mouth. \u201cBegin!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>With that, the duelists launched at each other, swords clashing head on. The deafening clangs resonated across the drill hall. The training swords were becoming ragged from their intense fight.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHuh, you\u2019re not as bad as I thought. Figured you would\u2019ve dropped in the first clash.\u201d Kayrach sent a thrust at Pram\u2019s thigh. The boy deftly avoided the attack and responded with a horizontal slash at Kayrach\u2019s shoulder. In terms of speed, Pram was unmatched. The torrent of attacks battered Kayrach from every angle. However, Kayrach\u2019s skill left Pram in the dust. He wasn\u2019t the captain of the guard for nothing. With minimal effort, he parried Pram\u2019s attacks, and retaliated with his own moves.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWatch yourself! You\u2019ve left openings all over because you\u2019re too excited.\u201d Kayrach tore into Pram, exposing numerous openings with his swordplay. With just one move, Pram lost the initiative and was at the mercy of Kayrach\u2019s blade. In an instant, Pram turned his body off to the side. By a paper thin margin, Kayrach\u2019s sword missed its target.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Let\u2019s create some distance.\u2019 Pram backed about five paces away from the captain for a breather. \u201cOh?\u201d He expected Kayrach to chase after him, but he stood in place with a frown on his face.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAs expected, you are still inexperienced.\u201d Kayrach raised his hand towards Pram. \u201cCreating distance from a magician.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>[Ice Blast]</p>",
    "<p>A frigid bolt homed in on Pram. The slender boy ducked to evade, but the missile exploded in mid air as it came close. A white mist engulfed Pram and a chill encroached on his body. \u201cYou still have a long way to go.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The weight of a training sword rested on his shoulder, but to Pram, it was heavier than the weight of the world.</p>"
