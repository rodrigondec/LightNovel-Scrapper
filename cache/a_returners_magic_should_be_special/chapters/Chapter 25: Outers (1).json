    "<p>\u201cHumanity is currently at war with the Shadow World,\u201d the guest lecturer explained.</p>",
    "<p>Desir nodded along as the memories of his past life raced through his mind. Shadow World. A calamity that occurred every year. The greatest threat humanity had ever come in direct contact with.</p>",
    "<p>The lecturer continued, \u201cit is the characteristic of the Shadow World to continuously encroach on the real world. Encroached land will become surrounded by a dark fog. To date, no human has survived stepping foot into those lands.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cA devoured land becomes unable to sustain human civilization. The Tower of Magic has come to refer to this phenomenon as \u2018Shadowfication.\u2019 We fight against the Shadow World to stop this process.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe have been fighting the Shadow World for a long time, but the majority of our efforts have been marred with failure. Humanity has experienced defeat again and again, and much of our land has become Shadowfied. Less than half our continent\u2019s original mass remains in our control.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir grimaced as he remembered the future yet to come. \u2018Humanity will continue to experience defeat.\u2019 He looked around, noticing that students around the lecture hall were beginning to fall asleep. He chuckled silently. It meant, after all\u2026</p>",
    "<p>The lecturer continued, unaware or unfazed. \u201cOf course, this story must seem unbelievable to all of you. Currently, 99.9% of all Shadow World instances are handled successfully, so all of this talk of how dangerous Shadow World instances were in the past must seem quite boring to all of you.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The guest lecturer from the Tower of Magic stopped momentarily and caught his breath. He looked around the room, gauging the students\u2019 reactions, before resuming. \u201cHowever, we must all keep in mind that not even a half-century has passed since we gained this overwhelming advantage against the Shadow World.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>48 years. That\u2019s how long it had been since humanity finally managed to improve their success rate above 60%. In other words, humanity was able to steal the momentum against the Shadow World.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAn ongoing debate exists within academia regarding what truly lead to this change. Some academics may identify 3 key reasons, while another might point to 5. However, all academics are in agreement on one particular factor.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe became capable of using magic crystals. All academics agree that this discovery represented a turning point that ultimately lead to our current success against the Shadow Worlds.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Magic crystal. Mana condensed into a crystallized form. Magic crystals could be earned by clearing the Shadow World instances. Prior to 48 years ago, magic crystals had been disregarded as worthless, but that had been the strange consequence of their composition, which was based on their creation.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMagic crystals are largely divided into two parts; the \u2018exterior mana\u2019 and the \u2018interior mana.\u2019 The \u2018exterior mana\u2019 is, as the name implies, an exterior covering, of solid, crystallized mana. Underneath the hard exterior is a flowing liquid interior: the \u2018interior mana.\u2019\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The exterior mana\u2019s crystallized state rendered it unusable. Humans could only make use of the interior mana\u2014if they could access it.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cA peculiar characteristic of the exterior mana is that it blocks all access to the interior mana underneath. Under normal conditions, the interior mana, no matter how vast and powerful it might be, is completely inaccessible. At the same time, we also couldn\u2019t simply break the magic crystal to release the interior mana.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir nodded in understanding. If the exterior mana broke, nothing held back the interior mana. As a result, it would rapidly dissipate into the air, like steam from an open kettle.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHowever, this problem, and similar such problems, were resolved 50 years ago, when the Tower of Magic developed the \u2018Enchant\u2019 technique.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>This topic evoked a bit of pride amongst those from the Tower of Magic, for good reason.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIn simple terms, a miniscule hole is formed in the exterior mana, by a technique developed by the Tower of Magic. The interior mana is directed to flow in a single direction, through this hole, and a formula is laid on top of the hole, to permit the crystal to be activated.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Indeed, once a method of utilizing the interior mana of the magic crystal had been established, magic crystals were no longer useless rocks, but critical resources. They enabled the development of a countless variety of magic equipment, leading to an explosive growth in magitek and magic industry: a Magical Revolution. It would not be far-fetched to claim that the Enchant technique was the discovery that defined that century.</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026and if we summarized the changes that followed this development\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The lecturer began displaying his prepared material, in order to refresh the room\u2019s mood. Panels activated by magic crystals displayed various images one by one. Communication devices, powered by magic, that would enable people to talk across vast distances. An automatic lift that traveled up and down tall buildings in seconds. The intercontinental train with its magic engine.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe are living in the height of the Magical Revolution, an era of grand magic. An era where everyone can experience the benefits of magic.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir nodded. Indeed, for now, life was prosperous and the population was growing. Shadow World instances were hundreds of times easier to clear, compared to before.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOf course, at the same time, we must recognize that the Magical Revolution has created some unfavorable changes as well. The increased value of magic crystals has led to the creation of an outlaw group who attempt to illegally acquire magic crystals. This group, which calls themselves the \u2018Outers,\u2019 are a sinister organization of serious criminals. They have broken the Treaty of Bern and attempted several attacks on the Tower of Magic and the Western Kingdoms.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pros and cons. The Enchant technique had made all of this possible.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNow, how about a question? What is the name of the person who developed the Enchant technique? Hmm\u2026The girl dozing off, over there. Romantica, was it?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHuh? What?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica, whose head had been bobbing up and down as she slipped in and out of sleep, jumped out of her seat in a panic as she heard her name.</p>",
    "<p>With an ungraceful clunk, the chair fell backwards behind her. Snickers echoed around the room. Desir, who had been sitting beside her, carefully fixed her chair before whispering quietly into her ears, \u201cThe answer is \u2018Zod Exarion, Romantica.\u2019\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Zod Exarion!\u201d She fumbled for the words.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cCorrect,\u201d replied the lecturer as he nodded in approval. \u201cThe one who occupies the position of Head of the Tower of Magic, Zod Exarion. You may sit.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis story has taken a detour like rabbit lost in the mountains. In any case, the conclusion I want you all to keep in mind as I wrap up today, is that the Shadow World is like a double-edged sword. It continuously wants to eat away at humanity\u2019s territories, but, at the same time, provides us with the magic crystals we need to advance our progress.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The dozing students began to rouse themselves one by one as everything appeared to wrap up.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll end the class here. Students that have questions can come forward, but otherwise, class dismissed.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The students stood up, and began streaming out the back door in a remarkably orderly fashion. Only a single student seemed to be moving against the crowd towards the lecturer\u2014but, on closer inspection, there were in fact two students beside him; a student whose gender was difficult to discern, and the female student who had been dozing off earlier. The lecturer smiled inwardly at this sight.</p>",
    "<p>The male student in the lead spoke. \u201cI am Desir Arman. On this side is Romantica Eru, and on this side is Pram Schneizer. We\u2019re all Single Rankers and in the same party.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOh? Single Rankers? This is quite the honor.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNo, no, it is an honor for us to be graced with your great lecture, Mr. Prelude.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo, what is your question?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNot really a question, per se, but a request.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Prelude felt an ominous foreboding as he realized where this conversation was headed. He paused briefly, before speaking very delicately. \u201cAre you perhaps requesting a sponsorship from the Tower of Magic?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a similar request,\u201d replied Desir nonchalantly.</p>",
    "<p>Prelude\u2019s face grew stiff. There were always students like this, who were willing to cross any line in order to get a sponsorship from the Tower of Magic. It was hardly surprising; the sponsorship was a great help to any burgeoning party. He replied, in a very even voice, \u201cthe request for sponsorship from the Tower of Magic is always reviewed fairly. I believe the window for applications for this year\u2019s sponsorship has come to an end.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHaha, well, that\u2019s regrettable, but, truthfully, I wasn\u2019t able to process one due to interference from another party.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cInterference from another party?\u201d asked Prelude, puzzled.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes; it\u2019s because there\u2019s too much pushback against my party. A three person party, mostly made up of commoners. We\u2019re not viewed in a great light by others.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAhhh, so you were that party. The rumored party from the Beta Class that became Single Rankers.\u201d Prelude nodded in understanding. News of Desir\u2019s party had spread far and wide. Their individual names, clearly, weren\u2019t well known yet, but many rumors had begun to circulate about how great Hebrion\u2019s \u2018Super Rookies\u2019 were. They had become quite the hot topic, and for them to be composed of students from the Beta Class\u2026well, opposition was only natural. Still, rules were rules. Prelude continued, \u201cunfortunately, the window for requests has already closed, and we\u2019re currently in the process of deliberation. I\u2019m sorry, but it might be best to hope for next year.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir, rather than give up as Prelude expected, tilted his head quizzically at the reply. \u201cHmm\u2026\u201d he paused, and then spoke again. \u201cI must have misspoke.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking for a sponsorship, per se. To borrow your idiom, we\u2019ve become lost like rabbits in a field, and this story has taken an unexpected turn. Is this saying correct?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s rabbits in a mountain,\u201d corrected Prelude. \u201cIn that case,\u201d he continued, \u201cwhat are you asking of me?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>In response, Desir wordlessly revealed the document he had been carrying, and handed it to Prelude. It was a written request.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s permissible for anyone to make a request for a party from Hebrion Academy with a reward.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking the question because I\u2019m unaware. I am fully aware of this, as the Tower of Magic has made a request for a party from Hebrion Academy before. I am asking why you are handing me this.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir smiled as he opened the lid of a pen and handed it to Prelude.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMake the request.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cPlease make this request.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI hope that you will make this request of us.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The three members of Desir\u2019s party all spoke in unison.</p>",
    "<p>Prelude shook his head, and closed the pen. \u201cNo, the problem wasn\u2019t with how you\u2019ve phrased it.\u201d He handed the pen and the paper back to Desir.</p>",
    "<p>Desir refused to take them. \u201cYou must make this request.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou are being completely unreasonable.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cUnreasonable?\u201d Desir smiled innocently at Prelude. \u201cTheir objective is the 2nd tier magic crystal held within Aeurelli. It will happen July 7th at 3 a.m.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Prelude asked, confused yet again.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI have information that the Outers will attack the Aeurelli Branch of the Tower of Magic exactly 10 hours from now,\u201d Desir stated matter-of-factly.</p>",
    "<p>They were called the \u2018Outers\u2019 because they stood outside the lines of law, and they revelled in the name. They were a sinister group, one that had already attacked the Tower of Magic and the Western Kingdoms several times.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThey\u2019re after Ruigenell\u2019s Tear.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Prelude blanched. \u201cWait, how could you know that\u2014\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir cut him off very suddenly. \u201cThe important part is that I also know how to stop them. Please put in a request to the Tower of Magic to hire us.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The root of the incident occurred 3 days prior, on July 4th. Desir\u2019s entire party had been promoted to Single Rankers during the promotion event. As part of the promotion, they also gained access to a new (substantially nicer) office. The interior walls were a calming white, and the space was filled with plush chairs and gleaming desks in a comforting brown, with a view of the beautiful emerald lake through the windows.</p>",
    "<p>As usual, Desir\u2019s party was spending their afternoon at this office, once their training had concluded, and it was here that Desir made a very important decision.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018I should definitely marry a woman like Pram.\u2019 Of course, this decision certainly wouldn\u2019t affect who he was actually going to marry in the future.</p>",
    "<p>As usual, there was a mountainous pile of documents stacked on top of the desk. As Desir worked, he grabbed at the cookies laid out before him. They were flour cookies baked in butter, and although they didn\u2019t look particularly appealing, they were surprisingly delicious. Pram had made them all by hand. Desir nodded in his mind in approval. \u2018He\u2019s pretty, with a good personality, and capable in the kitchen. He really isn\u2019t lacking anything.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Pram had taken on all the housekeeping tasks for the party. Nobody had asked him to\u2014it was something he had taken on of his own initiative. He was impressively good at them too; he did a fantastic job of cleaning, but his cooking skills were even better. And not just cookies\u2014he brewed an excellent tea.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Really,\u2019 Desir thought, \u2018would a professional maid be able outperform him?\u2019 His mind continued to wander. \u2018How amazing would it be if Pram were a girl? No, wait, is he actually a girl? If that were the case\u2026\u2019</p>",
    "<p>A voice suddenly interrupted Desir\u2019s thoughts.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMr. Desir.\u201d</p>"
