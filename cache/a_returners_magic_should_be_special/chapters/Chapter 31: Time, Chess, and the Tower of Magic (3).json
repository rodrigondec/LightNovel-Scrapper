    "<p>The sound of Zod making his move brought Desir\u2019s attention back to the present.</p>",
    "<p>While he was reminiscing about his previous life that happened in the future, he was driven into a corner in less than 100 moves by the Zod in front of him who existed 13 years in the past.</p>",
    "<p>This was to be expected, as Zod\u2019s skill did not change much between the two timeframes. However, for Desir, the bigger reason he was struggling was Zod\u2019s mentality. As the future Zod had lived through a harsh battlefield, his moves tended to be more aggressive and domineering as a result. The current Zod, on the other hand, was more reserved and focused on counterplay.</p>",
    "<p>Desir, who was expecting the future Zod\u2019s style of play, found himself unable to read the opponent in front of him. So instead, Desir offered one piece after another in order to analyze the current Zod. As a result, he was close to losing.</p>",
    "<p>The pieces were not thrown away wastefully, however. He had sacrificed pieces to test Zod\u2019s reactions while making sure to keep enough pieces on the board to mount a comeback. This had been Desir\u2019s plan all along. It was a playstyle that was unique to him.</p>",
    "<p>The current Zod must have some habits that were shared with his future counterpart. Desir gladly sacrificed his pieces in order to find these habits. Discovering them meant that he would be able to predict Zod\u2019s next moves.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018I did manage to figure him out, but\u2026\u2019 with his last knight captured, Desir was barely able to stay half a step ahead of Zod, \u2018if I\u2019m at this much of a disadvantage, I won\u2019t be able to make a comeback even if I could predict his moves.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>That would definitely have been the case if the situation was normal. However, there was a variable in this match that was out of the ordinary.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s your turn,\u201d Zod prompted him and Desir made a move in reply, using his warship to block off the only path to his king. Zod finally understood why Desir pulled his warship all the way back and sacrificed his other pieces. The warship\u2019s defense was the best out of all the pieces. If it was a frontal attack, the warship could thwart it completely simply by existing.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHow persistent. The match is already decided.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEven so, I\u2019d like to play it out and hold on with all I have.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026But I don\u2019t think anything you do can affect the outcome.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou never know what will happen until the end.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo you say.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>***</p>",
    "<p>It was Zod\u2019s turn. His fingers idly played with the pile of pieces that he\u2019d captured from Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018First move the knights back, then regroup to slowly corner him,\u2019 thought Zod. \u2018That should break his defense, even if he has a warship. Take out the warship and the game is over.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>The only issue was, he would need at least 30 turns to execute this plan. 30 turns was an issue.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018There is no time,\u2019 Zod glanced at his watch and fiddled with his pieces anxiously. The time was 4:22. The meeting was starting at 4:27, meaning he had less than five minutes left. Not enough time for 30 turns. \u2018In that case, I need to end this quickly.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Desir\u2019s king was right in front of the knight, less than three spaces away. If Zod was able to advance and take down the king, the game would be over.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018I could go for the win with just my knights,\u2019 Zod was confident that he didn\u2019t need 30 turns to win. \u2018First, attack the warship with my knight and then use the other knights to mate the king.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>***</p>",
    "<p>Desir smiled with satisfaction as Zod advanced his knight.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018He got greedy, as expected.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Zod was feeling the pressure of the time constraints and had made the worst move possible. It was exactly what Desir was waiting for.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018The winner was decided the moment you told me that you only had 27 minutes to play.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Desir\u2019s following moves would have seemed confusing to spectators, as he repositioned his pieces without concern for the danger posed to his king. However,  Zod was able to figure out Desir\u2019s intent unbelievably quickly.</p>",
    "<p>***</p>",
    "<p>\u2018He\u2019s changing formations,\u2019 Zod thought.</p>",
    "<p>Up until now, Desir had not fully committed to either offense or defense. His pieces were scattered across the board, almost randomly. It was the main reason why Zod had been able to break Desir\u2019s defenses.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Changing formation is definitely the correct play, but\u2026\u2019 Having already pinned Desir as a weaker player, Zod was unperturbed. Shaking his head, he thought, \u2018It\u2019s too late now to try changing formations.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>***</p>",
    "<p>At the same time, Desir was thinking, \u2018He\u2019s thinking that it\u2019s too late. That\u2019s a big mistake.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>With a few quick moves, Desir regrouped his knights and rooks in the center of the board, blocking in Zod\u2019s knights from three sides. The scattered formation had transformed into an encirclement and a tight defensive line was created in an instant.</p>",
    "<p>Desir\u2019s aimless-looking positioning was in fact deliberate and calculated, ready to switch to offense or defense in response to Zod\u2019s play.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHm?\u201d Zod watched as Desir created a concentrated attack using a pawn and a rook, with the warship as their lead. Despite being cornered, Desir poured all his available resources into attacking the knight. There was no way Zod could stop all these pieces with only a knight.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis\u2026what!?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The comeback had begun. Desir\u2019s pawns easily thwarted the knight\u2019s attack and pushed toward Zod\u2019s warship. His rook joined the fight and crushed the supply lines. In a blink of an eye, every one of Zod\u2019s knights were destroyed.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018It\u2019s too late now even if he\u2019s realized his mistake.\u2019 Desir reorganized his pieces again. Within three turns, his formation flipped from defense to offense. All of Desir\u2019s pieces rushed to invade Zod\u2019s territory.</p>",
    "<p>Zod maneuvered his pieces to the center to defend, intending to clash head on with Desir\u2019s forces.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018He should be reeling from losing his knights, but he still has enough pieces remaining to push me back.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>As if he was mocking Zod\u2019s efforts, Desir turned his pieces west just before the two sides collided. Their new target was\u2026Zod\u2019s isolated warship.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Zod doesn\u2019t like using his warships to attack. The fact that he never used them, even when he had the lead, proves this.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Zod\u2019s warship sunk under the concentrated attack. As noted before, a player gains an extra turn after destroying a warship. Desir used this extra turn to seize Zod\u2019s supply line. The supply line that Zod had so carefully built up was now in Desir\u2019s hands.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018I\u2019ll focus my attacks on the weakened western front.\u2019 Following the destruction of the warship, Desir\u2019s pieces flanked Zod from the west. Zod attempted to turn his pieces around, but without his knights, he was too slow to respond. As a result, Zod\u2019s left side was routed.</p>",
    "<p>Zod pulled pieces away from his eastern front to strike at Desir\u2019s supply line. However, Desir\u2019s warship, which was no longer needed to defend his king, was already in position to repel the attack. Desir was already familiar with Zod\u2019s habit of targeting supply lines.</p>",
    "<p>***</p>",
    "<p>\u2018He\u2019s got me.\u2019 A chill ran down Zod\u2019s spine. He tried to pull back his soldiers from the supply line attack, but it was too late. He had already committed too many moves to the attack. In the meanwhile, Desir had taken all of Zod\u2019s pawns, which were vital for maneuvering his troops.</p>",
    "<p>There were too many fires to put out. In a last ditch move, Zod pushed in all of his pieces, not just the center ones, toward Desir\u2019s king.</p>",
    "<p>***</p>",
    "<p>Seeing Zod\u2019s tactic, Desir was now certain of his win.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Too hasty. Such a quick push leaves many of your pieces hanging.\u2019 It was rare to see Zod, who had always strived for perfection, panic and lose his composure.</p>",
    "<p>Desir could see the path to victory. One by one, he picked off Zod\u2019s scattered pieces. The material advantage that Zod held throughout the game was lost in the blink of an eye. Finally, Zod\u2019s other warship fell.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cCheck.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>It was 4:25.</p>",
    "<p>The Master of the Tower of Magic tipped over his king.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s my loss.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Zod\u2019s Pad vibrated. He glanced at the screen and told Desir, \u201cMy secretary.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAh, please take the call then. Don\u2019t mind me.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Zod pushed a button and a gentle female voice spoke.</p>",
    "<p>\u2014 \u201cSir, the meeting begins in three minutes. You should come out soon.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAh, I will be there shortly. Please wait a moment.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Zod ended his conversation with the push of another button on the Pad. He tapped the chessboard with his bejeweled fingers.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I would lose,\u201d Zod said, with a hint of satisfaction in his voice.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou would have won if there was no time limit, sir.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSpare me your sympathy.\u201d Zod pushed the chessboard aside. \u201cNow let\u2019s hear it. What is your request?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMy request is a deal. An equal exchange.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cA deal?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes, a deal.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cA deal\u2026and what would be the specifics of this deal?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI have an idea that I can give you in exchange for support on the level of the Tower of Magic\u2019s sponsorship.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Zod arched an eyebrow.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo not an unconditional support. I suppose it doesn\u2019t violate our agreement if it\u2019s an equal exchange\u2026\u201d Zod thought for a moment before shaking his head, \u201cHow troublesome. I find this request disagreeable.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou lost the wager, sir.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat I did. So I must honor a request from you. But what you\u2019re requesting here is a deal. An equal exchange. How is this equal?\u201d Zod spoke calmly, \u201cThink about it, Desir. It\u2019s equal if both parties gauge the things being exchanged to have the same value. An idea from a single student versus the backing of the greatest corporation? This is not a deal.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEven if there is a bit of difference in value, you\u2019re obligated to honor my request.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe difference in value here is not trivial. You\u2019re asking to exchange a bar of gold for a peanut. You cannot call that a deal. Though we would be using a loophole, it is basically the same as an unconditional sponsorship, which we agreed is off the table.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou can say that I\u2019m being cheap. I know you want the Tower of Magic\u2019s sponsorship, but this is too unreasonable. I\u2019d ask you to make a different request.\u201d The Tower Master continued after a moment of silence, \u201cIf you can\u2019t think of anything, I\u2019ll make a suggestion. Request for a bigger reward for fending off the Outers\u2019 raid. I can accept that. If you make that request, I\u2019ll offer you funds equal in value to the 2nd tier magic crystal you recovered. From now until your graduation, I\u2019ll donate 120 gold to your party every month.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Editor\u2019s Rant: Can I just say how disappointed I am? As a chess enthusiast, I was happy to tackle chapter 30 and 31. I was hoping for a description of a game that I could imagine and follow along in my head, even with its nonsensical ruleset (apparently it matters which way your pieces are facing in North Sea chess? That\u2019s not going to be problematic :p). Instead, author-nim denied me of this pleasure by putting in zero effort to create an actual coherent series of events.</p>",
    "<p>How is it that Desir is reduced to \u201csix pawns, two rooks, one bishop, and one king\u201d and then suddenly has a warship available to defend? How can you say that all of Desir\u2019s knights were destroyed and then give at least two back to him for his counterattack? Is Desir cheating? Did he decide to promote a pawn into a knight? Desir can\u2019t be *that* big of an idiot\u2026</p>"
