    "<p>\u201cAre you from the North Sea region?\u201d asked Zod.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Desir replied, \u201cbut I used to have an acquaintance from that region. It\u2019s thanks to them that I mastered the North Sea rules.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSounds like you had no choice but to learn it.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat was indeed the case.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt must have been rough. The North Sea rules are difficult.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt certainly was.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Zod\u2019s body language seemed to relax. And it wasn\u2019t just wishful thinking on Desir\u2019s part. Compared to just moments prior, Zod\u2019s sense of urgency had eased off significantly. This was no doubt due to Desir mentioning the ruleset that originated from Zod\u2019s homeland.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cVery well,\u201d said Zod, \u201cwe shall play with the North Sea rules.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Zod flipped the chessboard over, then widened the board on both sides. The usual square board was now lengthened horizontally.</p>",
    "<p>The North Sea rules differed from regular chess in several ways. There were five more rows and columns, which came with additional pieces for each added column. As a result, there are four bishops and knights on each side. Furthermore, there were two warship pieces instead of the queen, referencing the naval background of the North Sea region. In fact, the ruleset included many characteristics meant to emulate actual warfare.</p>",
    "<p>For example, if a pawn does not move for a turn, it may establish a supply line. Supply lines allow pieces within it to move twice in one turn. It was a different take on chess, to the extent that one could say that it was a completely different game that just happened to use chess pieces.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSame, let\u2019s have a good game.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The clock struck four o\u2019clock as the chess match between Tower Master Zod and Desir began.</p>",
    "<p>Both contenders were evenly matched through the opening. Zod carefully surveyed the chessboard, his eyes calmly analyzing the position. Zod\u2019s pieces were perfectly synchronized. The bishops was on the offensive, supported by the knights, making room for a pawn push. Meanwhile, the rooks anchored the formation, defending the sides of the warships. It was a sophisticated defensive position with no gaps in sight.</p>",
    "<p>In stark contrast, Desir\u2019s pieces had no organization at all. The warships were in the back, the pawns interfered with the knight\u2019s movements, and the arrangement of the rooks were in disarray. Dysfunctionality was the theme that permeated on Desir\u2019s side of the board.</p>",
    "<p>Despite this disparity, the match was in a deadlock. However, Desir would be the one to contest that deadlock. Pushing a pawn forward, he challenged Zod\u2019s own pawn.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018!?\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Without hesitation, Desir\u2019s pawn cut down its opponent, threatening Zod\u2019s defensive position and earning some praise from Zod.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI must compliment you on your bold strategy,\u201d commented Zod as he used a knight to knock off Desir\u2019s pawn from the board. Unfazed, Desir continued the exchange using his rook to retake the knight.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHowever,\u201d continued Zod, \u201cI\u2019m afraid you are too hasty.\u201d Following his calculated moves, Zod took a bishop from the opposite side of the board and knocked off Desir\u2019s rook, ending the first major exchange of the game.</p>",
    "<p>In this war of attrition, Desir\u2019s side was considerably more battered. Early on, he had lost a knight and was now even further down on the exchange. However, the piece sacrifices were not in vain. The western side of the board, where Zod\u2019s bishop originated, was no longer impenetrable.</p>",
    "<p>Desir advanced his pawn, taking advantage of the defensive gap. Zod attempted a response, but Desir had already positioned his warship early on to take advantage of that gap. Thus, Desir\u2019s mighty warship broke through Zod\u2019s defenses. In an instant, the defense was overrun and the western side of the board was in shambles.</p>",
    "<p>Zod looked at Desir in surprise.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018He\u2019s pretty good. He\u2019s skilled for sure, but he\u2019s still just a student.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>From the ruined defensive formation, Zod had positioned a knight near some pawns for a special tactic. Desir had positioned his pieces to quickly penetrate through Zod\u2019s defenses, but left himself open to a counterattack as a consequence. With a decisive move, Zod tore apart Desir\u2019s supply lines, preventing him from moving quickly and allowing Zod to calmly and efficiently capture isolated pieces.</p>",
    "<p>Try as he might, Desir was unable to stop the counterattack. His warship was surrounded by pawns and ultimately fell to Zod\u2019s bishop.</p>",
    "<p>It was a successful counter-offensive. Desir had lost many pieces and would need to regroup before he could make another play. It was the perfect time for Zod to go on full offense.</p>",
    "<p>In North Sea rules, when a player sinks a warship, they are granted another turn. Zod utilized this extra move to advance his front line, taking advantage of the supply lines created by his pawns. Desir tried to disrupt the supply lines with his own pieces, but were blocked by the opposing knight.</p>",
    "<p>Zod advanced his pieces methodically. With his supply line securely defended, his army was able to move forward in a tight formation. In just five short turns, there was a huge supply line that was stretched diagonally across the playing field.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Desir paused to think. He was definitely at a disadvantage. Zod\u2019s supply line was particularly bothersome. Through this supply line, Zod\u2019s pieces were able to maneuver nimbly through Desir\u2019s front line. It was a fierce match.</p>",
    "<p>Without missing a beat, Desir repelled Zod\u2019s invasion with his own pieces. Sparks flew as the front lines clashed and held their ground. Desir\u2019s positioning neither focused on offense or defense. It was almost nonsensical.</p>",
    "<p>Zod, on the other hand, was focused on his attack. He concentrated his pieces on a single square and broke past Desir\u2019s defenses, successfully penetrating the formation. The casualty of this attack was a bishop and disruption of Desir\u2019s pawn formation. Zod then followed up by capturing two of Desir\u2019s remaining three knights. Victory did not seem far away.</p>",
    "<p>Desir made an attempt to halt the advance, but it was not sufficient. Zod\u2019s pieces moved in sync, preventing any counter play. His rook supported his pawns as they invaded and established a new supply line, further increasing his advantage. Zod\u2019s play was methodical, calmly creating a siege line while simultaneously pressuring with an attack.</p>",
    "<p>Ignoring the danger posed to his other pieces, Desir chose to retreat his warship first. Even then, it was horribly outnumbered.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018It\u2019s over,\u2018 thought Zod. Desir\u2019s initial attack was strong, but that was all he offered this game. As the Tower Master expected, the young student was no match for him. Though the game was enjoyable, it was time to finish the match.</p>",
    "<p>As Zod was about to reach for a piece, Desir, who had not said a word throughout the entire game, finally spoke.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWould you like to make a wager?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cA wager?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s correct. If something was at stake, we would try our hardest, right?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Zod immediately understood Desir\u2019s intent. A normal person would not refuse a reward of 120 gold pieces and ask for a chess game instead. There were definitely ulterior motives at work.</p>",
    "<p>Zod\u2019s lip curled into a smile. Building up expectations for Desir\u2019s request, Zod asked, \u201cWhat sort of wager did you have in mind?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cLet\u2019s keep it simple. How about if the loser has to fulfill one request from the winner?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>It was a simple wager. However, the stakes were outrageous.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat exactly could I request from you?\u201d bemused Zod, \u201cwhat could a student like yourself offer to me, the Tower Master?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou could have me work in the Tower of Magic? Despite appearances, I am first among the Single Rankers, even though I am a first year student. When it comes to magic, I am confident that I am second to none.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s fair. In that case, my request to you will be that you come work for the Magic Engineering Department immediately after graduation.\u201d Zod, knowing Desir\u2019s background, decided his request without hesitation.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIsn\u2019t a guaranteed job more beneficial to me?\u201d asked Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou\u2019re still a first year student and you\u2019re already talented enough to be a Single Ranker. For the Tower of Magic to acquire such a talent without needing to invest in scouting is beneficial enough for us, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI see. I guess it\u2019s my turn to state my request.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHold on. Before I hear your request, I must say one thing.\u201d Zod held up a hand, anticipating Desir\u2019s request, \u201cI refuse to provide sponsorship.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou are being very thorough, I see.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOf course. Rules are rules, there will be no exceptions. The application period has already passed and I can\u2019t give you an exception. Rules are important.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI agree wholeheartedly that rules are important. So there is no need for you to be concerned with such matters. I\u2019ve said this many times already, but I have no intention of seeking sponsorship.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIs that so? Then I am very curious as to what your request is.\u201d Zod could not hide the fact that his interest was piqued. \u201cYou somehow obtained information on an Outers raid and were instrumental in stopping them. Then, you refused the reward of 120 gold and asked for a chess game with me instead. Finally, you elected to play with the North Sea rules, which you must have known somehow was from my homeland. What kind of request is worth all that effort? Aside from sponsorship, I have no idea.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>It was more of a statement than a question. A declaration that Zod was fully aware of Desir\u2019s every action thus far. Unfazed, Desir continued.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think that you would be that curious about my request. Since that is the case, how about I keep it to myself for now so that you can savor the moment? After all, the most anticipated gift is the one you unwrap last.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good analogy. I like it. I\u2019ll entertain your offer then.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Confident in his victory, Zod didn\u2019t see the need to continue questioning Desir. Zod wasn\u2019t being conceited. Anyone looking at the state of the chessboard would say that the game was clearly in Zod\u2019s favor. Desir only had six pawns, two rooks, one bishop, and one king remaining. All of his knights were eliminated. It would not have been unusual for a player to resign at this point.</p>",
    "<p>Desir himself knew this, but he was not ready to throw in the towel.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018As expected, a genius is a genius,\u2019 admired Desir. \u2018This position is no joke. What\u2019s scary is that, even though he\u2019s ahead, he\u2019s not letting up one bit.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>In terms of skill, Zod was definitely the better player. This was true in the current moment as well as in Desir\u2019s past. In his past life, Desir had already played chess against Zod many times.</p>",
    "<p>The survivors of the Shadow Labyrinth all had their own hobbies. It was something required to help them hold onto their sanity on that brutal battlefield. For Pram, it was cooking, though the choice of ingredients was slim. For Romantica, it was singing. For Saintess Priscilla, prayer.</p>",
    "<p>And for Desir and Zod, it was chess.</p>",
    "<p>The two of them carved out chess pieces from rocks and a chessboard from a boulder. When it came to the ruleset, Desir wanted to use the Hebrion rules, but Zod insisted on the North Sea rules. In the end, Zod had his way and Desir bitterly learnt the North Sea ruleset.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018It truly was rough.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>He had to learn and adapt to the extra pieces, the new warship piece, and a slew of special rules. How many days did it take before the unfamiliar rules felt natural? Desir could not recall. Eventually, however, Desir did master the ruleset and was able to play against Zod in earnest.</p>",
    "<p>And was defeated.</p>",
    "<p>Absolutely crushed.</p>",
    "<p>Like a toddler, who just learned to walk, having a race against a professional sprinter, the difference in skill and ability was large. It was a scenario where a more sympathetic player may let the newer player win a game now and then in order to encourage them. However, despite the disparity in skill and experience, not once did Zod allow Desir to win. Not a single game in six years.</p>",
    "<p>Naturally, playing against the same opponent repeatedly for six years would result in familiar positions and patterns emerging. Over time, Desir saw every strategy Zod had to offer and eventually got to the point where he was no longer being crushed and could barely hold on against him.</p>"
