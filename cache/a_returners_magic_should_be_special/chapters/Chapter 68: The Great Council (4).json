    "<p>Starting with Romantica, Pram and Adjest also easily won their matches. After clearing the round of 16, they all reached the quarter-finals. Those who participated in the Yellow Ocean Competition were all high-levelled, and making it to the quarter-finals meant that their skills were remarkably high. Pram, Romantica, and Adjest triumphantly left the stadium. Since the quarter-finals were scheduled to begin at 3:00, they had two hours spare to eat.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI think that I\u2019ve improved a lot compared to the past.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s obvious because you train so hard.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The council meeting wasn\u2019t over yet, so they had to eat by themselves. They had seen a place for pasta on the way here before, so they decided to go there.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s such a shame that Romantica and Adjest have already met.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>As Pram said, Romantica and Adjest met immediately in the quarter-finals.</p>",
    "<p>At the time, Romantica said that there was nothing that could be done.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhy shame? I actually wanted to, so it was a good opportunity. Wasn\u2019t it, Adjest?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026well, at least once.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Adjest replied in a less enthusiastic manner. Pram asked Romantica:</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you feel frustrated when you fight against Adjest?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty confident in my skills. Not that I can afford to underestimate her.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica still remembered Adjest\u2019s incredible reflexes when they played volleyball. Adjest was a magic swordsman. She did not only have skills as a magician but also as a knight, so no one could dared challenge her lightly.</p>",
    "<p>Throughout all of the grades at Hebrion Academy, only a few people could overpower Adjest. Without Desir, she was probably the top of first-class singles.</p>",
    "<p>Rumble / glurp</p>",
    "<p>Anyway, such a painful comparison was of no use now. Romantica was very hungry because she used a lot of magic during the match.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAnyway, I need to eat first. I remember it was around here\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>There were so many people in the street that there was barely room to even walk. The street was crowded with all of the people who came to either watch the Yellow Ocean Competition or spend their vacation visiting the beach.</p>",
    "<p>Some people recognized Romantica, Adjest, and Pram. Waving at them to communicate their feelings. Some of these people cheered them on.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHey, Romantica! You should win! I bet all of my bar money for this month on you!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMs. Adjest! I\u2019m dead meat if you lose!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cPram, I don\u2019t care if you win or not. Just don\u2019t get hurt! You\u2019re just too damn precious!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Most of the encouraging words were related to betting. However, it was still pleasant to be recognized and famous by others. Romantica and Pram couldn\u2019t hide their bashful smiles. While they were walking along the street with a much lighter step than before, Romantica who was at the front of the group, suddenly stopped and looked back. There was a man who just passed her. The man was wearing a hood, but shortly before passing, she definitely caught a glimpse of what was inside of it from the corner of her eye.</p>",
    "<p>It was a crow mask.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIs something wrong, Romantica?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica became a Third-Circle Sorcerer, and the biggest difference was that she could feel more mana around her. Previously, she only sensed the presence of mana, but upon reaching the Third-Circle, it felt as though mana would soon be in her hands. And then, for the first time, Romantica realized that mana had a slightly different nature for each person.</p>",
    "<p>A small but subtly flowing mana for Desir. Adjest\u2019s frigid-cold mana that seemingly stung like frostbite.</p>",
    "<p>And\u2026</p>",
    "<p>\u2018It feels like I have felt this mana somewhere.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>It was definitely the mana she felt somewhere. And it wasn\u2019t too long ago.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Right, that time\u2026\u2019</p>",
    "<p>The wizard, who led the men that attacked the Ellueli chapter of the Tower of Magic, also had this mana.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica was in the Second-Circle, so she wasn\u2019t sure if what she felt at that time was the same as now, but she was sure that the feeling from that mana was similar to the man who just passed by her.</p>",
    "<p>Mana smelling like a sewer. It was a horrendous image that came to mind right away without even trying to remember. Romantic murmured to herself as she stared at the man who passed by her.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe Outsiders?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cPardon? What are you talking about all of a sudden?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica spoke, pointing to a man wearing a hood.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNo, that man has mana that\u2019s similar to what I felt during the Ellueli raid.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>She wasn\u2019t sure. She just had a similar feeling. But if Romantica\u2019s assumptions are true\u2026</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf so, it could be dangerous.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Adjest replied.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe way that man walks\u2026 Very unusual.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>It\u2019s as if he\u2019s ready for any attack. It felt as if he\u2019s been forged with a knife.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s also hiding his mana. I can\u2019t even tell how much he has.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Probably a very high-level wizard, far beyond their current abilities.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDon\u2019t think about it too much. It\u2019s only a feeling, and perhaps he\u2019s a grand wizard of some sort.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica barely shook off all of the ominous thoughts. She wanted to get to the bottom of it, but she couldn\u2019t blame the man without any evidence just based on her feelings.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cFirst of all, let\u2019s get something to eat. There it is.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica pointed at the sign of the restaurant that they just passed. The name of the restaurant was written in fancy print. Adjest and Pram no longer brought up the matter as if by prior agreement. The party went into the restaurant, and each ordered something that caught their eye. While they were eating and talking, the memory of the wizard soon started to fade away. Soon the topic moved to Desir, who wasn\u2019t present at the moment:</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI bet he\u2019s having a tough time.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram rebutted as Romantica made such a definitive statement.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think Desir is doing just fine? Desir has usually handled all situations that he\u2019s found himself in perfectly.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>It was the same in the promotion exam, and as well as in the Shadow World. Pram had placed his full trust in him. Adjest nodded in agreement.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. Dad and I have attended a few meetings with powerful people and they always insisted on pushing their opinions since they were only interested in their own benefits.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo, by now, there\u2019s definitely going to be a lot of arguments in the meeting. They will be pushing for their own justice and profit. Our poor, common, party leader in such battle. Can you even imagine?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDo you think Desir is gutless?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Adjest replied.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWell\u2026 Right. That\u2019s true. As long as there\u2019s no topic related to Hebrion\u2026 Yeah, there shouldn\u2019t be any issues.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>When their main dishes came out Romantica concluded the conversation.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe bottom line is, there\u2019s a situation that Desir can\u2019t solve so matter what.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The man in the hood headed off into the alley past the crowds. It was daylight, but it was a place with plenty of mold because the towering buildings didn\u2019t allow enough sunlight through. Broken bottles were scattered over the street interspersed with loose rubbish.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHebrion\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The muttering man\u2019s voice was mixed with emotions. He thought of the three boys and girls he just passed by. The clothes they were wearing were obviously the uniform of the Hebrion Empire. The only way to have such a uniform at that age was if they attended the Hebrion Academy. They are perhaps the top-class pupils of the Hebrion Academy.</p>",
    "<p>Above all, the man clearly heard the voice of one of the girls.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cShe has good senses.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The girl had especially sensitive intuition. It was doubtful that she sensed dark mana from the man. It was fortunate for them that they did not chase the man there. Third-Circle magic swordsman, knight class swordsman, and Third-Circle wind wizard. That\u2019s who they are. All together, they wouldn\u2019t leave a scratch on this man.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018I know I should kill even if they feel suspicious\u2026\u2019 but the man decided not to follow his instincts.</p>",
    "<p>He thought that even if he doesn\u2019t kill them right now, they will all die anyway. Leaving them alone now would only allow them to live for a while longer. The voices of people could only faintly be heard.</p>",
    "<p>His body scattered like a mist and soon re-appeared on top of a nearby building. He now had a clear view of the scenery of the Kingdom Frilleza. Streets where so many people stroll by, buildings with varying signs\u2026 Then his gaze stopped at a particular place. The top of the royal palace was looming in the distance, shining down on all from the radiant sunlight.</p>",
    "<p>He softly whispered, \u201cStart.\u201d</p>"
