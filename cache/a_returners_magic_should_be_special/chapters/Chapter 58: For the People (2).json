    "<p>An Artemis priest was outraged at Desir\u2019s proposal.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou call this scheme a plan? This is a rebellion. It\u2019s treason!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cFather,\u201d interjected Ajest, \u201cdon\u2019t interrupt the Lord.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The priest glared at Ajest with murderous eyes. He wanted to say more, but kept silent. It was a momentary respite, the same kind of peace they experienced last night when Desir asked for more time to resolve the vagrant issue. Eyulan and the priest glared at Desir. They wanted Desir\u2019s party to know that they would not stand by this course of action and were ready to leave at any time.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re essentially asking me to spark a rebellion,\u201d said the Lord. Even in this extremely tense situation, he was only focused on Desir. \u201cAre you aware of who I am?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou are the lord that rules over the Evernatten region,\u201d replied Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNot my name, but my past.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Wilhelm Evernatten, the fallen hero. As a cardinal, he achieved many great accomplishments leading his order of knights against the Shadow World. And before he was a cardinal, he was a knight who had devoted his life to the kingdom.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI have pledged my life to the Holy Kingdom and you\u2019re saying that, in order to save that very kingdom, I should start a rebellion?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Wilhelm achieved the highest order of knighthood as a Knight-captain. There was no questioning his loyalty to the kingdom.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018And yet\u2026\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Desir noticed that the Lord did not reject his proposal outright. The context of a conversation could be completely flipped depending on minor nuances. That was the case here. Wilhelm wasn\u2019t throwing accusations at Desir, but rather asking subtle questions in order to gauge his reaction.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018He is already aware that there is a bigger problem.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>This was a man that once held the lofty position of cardinal within the Holy Kingdom. It would be stranger if a person with such rank was unaware of the problems facing the kingdom.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018But he\u2019s unable to act due to his oaths.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Wilhelm was unable to pursue the ideals he valued because of his obligations to the kingdom. Desir mentally prepared his answer. It was time to help Wilhelm Evernatten realize what he was truly searching for.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI believe we have to make one thing clear. What was it that caused you to pledge your life and sword to the kingdom? I implore you to reflect on this cause.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir knew the answer already, even without hearing Wilhelm speak. This was a man that had accepted vagrants at the risk of peace and security within his own territory. Currently, the denizens of the Holy Kingdom were suffering under the church\u2019s corrupted ideology. They were chased from their homes and driven into the frozen outlands.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf the Lord originally picked up his sword for the sake of the people, then it would make sense for you to do so once again for the sake of the same people.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir used all the information that he had gathered on Wilhelm and carefully crafted a statement to strike right at the Lord\u2019s heart.</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026My life and sword were originally meant for the people.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir\u2019s words were starting to have an effect on Wilhelm.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI had always stood for the people since the beginning. I will do anything for their well-being. This is my one true conviction.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Wilhelm\u2019s eyes lit up, reflecting the blazing hot flames of the fireplace.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cKnowing this, I still question your proposal. Is calling for war truly for the people? War causes the suffering of countless innocents, Desir.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir could not deny this. Regardless of how nicely he worded it, in the end it was still a call for war.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt is possible that starting a war, instead of remaining silent, might cause more people to suffer. Answer me this, Desir. What will you do for those that will get swept into this war and suffer? Can you be so sure that war is the best course of action?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Regardless of the politics surrounding it, the ones who would feel the effects of war the most were the people. Men and supplies would need to be gathered in preparation for battle, which meant that families would be separated and people would go hungry. Even if they say that the war was \u2018for the people\u2019, it would be the people that would have to pay the cost for the war itself.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBut, Lord!\u201d It was at that moment that Romantica stepped forward.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOutsiders shouldn\u2019t say anything!\u201d intercepted Eyulan immediately. Romantica\u2019s body shook as she glared at Eyulan, but the knight was calmly focused on her liege.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIn that case, may I speak my mind?\u201d The Knight-captain Ajest stepped forward and the Lord nodded in response.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf people get swept into a war, they may or may not suffer more compared to what they\u2019re experiencing right now. However, if we let this stop us from acting, the suffering of the people will definitely get worse over time. The time to make your decision is now, my Lord.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAdditionally,\u201d continued Ajest, \u201cthe reason that the number of vagrants have grown so exceedingly is because the Church of Artemis have been forcibly taking many people as sacrifices.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>It was obvious to everyone why the church had suddenly required a large amount of sacrifices.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt must mean that a judgement of dangerous proportions is approaching.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir was surprised that the Lord was aware of this fact, but Ajest caught his attention with a gesture. By calmly speaking her mind, she had brought this insight to light. It was not an opportunity to be missed.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Nice assist, Ajest.\u2019 thought Desir as he immediately followed up on her words.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt might be a judgement that could affect the entire Holy Kingdom and maybe there is no one there that could properly deal with it.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir estimated that the impending Shadow World was a Grade-1 Shadow World. Even if they mustered every bit of strength they had, there would be no guarantee that they could repel a Shadow World of this magnitude.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe kingdom will be unable to fight against it and will be swallowed if we delay any longer,\u201d said Desir, with conviction. The Shadow World would lead to the death of every being within the Holy Kingdom, a fate incomparable to the suffering caused by a rebellion.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cKnight Eyulan, what do you think?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree with the premise in the first place,\u201d said Eyulan, with a hint of displeasure in her voice, \u201ceven if we did start a war, it would be for naught. I don\u2019t believe any one of the territories would be a match for the Holy City on the battlefield. Even though the soldiers in our territory are of higher quality, I see almost no chance of victory against the Holy City.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Even by modest accounts, Evernatten was only a medium-sized territory while the Holy City was the capital of the entire nation. The sheer difference in size was insurmountable.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI received word from another lord yesterday,\u201d said Wilhelm, \u201cit was a letter proposing that we take on the Holy City together. Of course, even if we joined forces, it would not improve our chances of success.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>A hint. The Lord was giving them a hint that other lords supporting the notion of a rebellion existed. There had to be some that were displeased with the Holy City. Some, like Wilhelm, might be champions of the people, while others might have concerns that the actions of the Holy City would affect the security of their territory. The specific motivation for each lord was unimportant, what was important was their available military force. If all these lords banded together, manpower would not be much of an issue.</p>",
    "<p>Wilhelm had to be aware of this as well, but his tone implied that he was still feeling guilty about the decision. If that was the case, it was now on Desir to help ease his burden.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe have the people\u2019s support, my lord.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe people\u2019s support?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Despite the damage it has caused our land, we willingly accept the countless vagrants that were displaced from the Holy City. This act alone justifies the rebellion.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>This was a line of reasoning that Desir would not be able to bring forth had the vagrants been expelled from Evernatten.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf we become a spark and make people aware of the Holy City\u2019s sinister deeds, then the lords of other territories are sure to support us.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Feudal lords who were aware of the situation within the Holy City, but were unwilling to take action, were sure to rally behind Lord Evernatten if he took the lead.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis,\u201d continued Desir, \u201cis all because we had accepted the vagrants who were escaping from the Holy City.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Wilhelm had taken in all the vagrants that were rejected by the other territories.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe Holy City has gone too far with their sinister deeds. With the people\u2019s support behind us, what lord would not join to support our cause? We have the famous Evernatten name, a justified call to action to correct the wrongdoings of the Holy Kingdom, and the urgency of stopping the encroaching judgement. The rebellion is the best course of action that I can propose to you, my lord.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir finished his speech and returned to his seat with his head bowed. He had said everything he wanted to say and done everything that he could. All that was left was for the lord to decide.</p>",
    "<p>The priest sniffled and Eyulan rubbed her brow anxiously. Desir was focused only on the Lord, watching in silence. The blaze in the fireplace crackled, assuring everyone that time was not frozen, but instead crawling at a painful pace. Finally, a decision was made.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cKnight Pram.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSend a missive to all the knights in every region. Desir, prepare a letter to each of the lords. Let all know that we can no longer sit idly by and watch the sinister deeds of the Holy City any longer. Let it be proclaimed that we can longer follow the doctrine of the incapable Church of Artemis!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Finally, the fallen hero had recovered his noble heart and taken up the sword once more.</p>",
    "<p>[Unique Hero: Wilhelm Evernatten has been changed into Epic Hero: Emperor Wilhelm Ludwig Evernatten.</p>",
    "<p>*The Vagrant Issue has been resolved: You have successfully determined the root of the Vagrant issue and presented a solution. You may have found a major event change that could prevent the fall of the Holy City. It might be that this hero will be able to remove the rot from the Holy City and pass judgement on all things that need to be judged. It might be that, if the Holy City avoids ruination, they could act as a shield against all future judgements, even those in present day.]</p>",
