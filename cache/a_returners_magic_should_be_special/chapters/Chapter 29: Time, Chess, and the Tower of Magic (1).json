    "<p>\u201cARGGH!\u201d Criken screamed in impotent rage as he struggled against the crushing force. It was useless. Sharp cracks accompanied blinding pain as the intolerable gravity began rending its terrible toll on his body. He howled in pain as he felt his bones crack.</p>",
    "<p>He let his body slump to the ground in defeat. His magic had been rendered powerless and his body was now incapacitated. Criken looked up at Desir with blurry eyes. It still made no sense. How could a boy who was barely even a 1st circle mage cast a 4th circle spell? It should\u2019ve been impossible!</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAlright, let me take this back now.\u201d Desir\u2019s voice was incredibly relaxed in contrast. On the edge of passing out from exhaustion, Criken could offer little resistance as Desir pried the crystal from his fingers.</p>",
    "<p>Shock ran through Criken as he saw the magic crystal in Desir\u2019s hand. The stone glowed with a fierce blue light. Beneath the translucent exterior, the crystal\u2019s interior mana swirled violently. Criken felt numb. \u2018He\u2019s using the crystal\u2019s mana? How? This should be impossible!\u2019 No known technology existed to utilize the interior mana of a magic crystal before it was enchanted. What Criken was seeing went against everything he knew.</p>",
    "<p>The crystal wasn\u2019t enchanted. This much was obvious. But, as if he was laughing in the face of common sense, the boy was using the crystal\u2019s mana like it was nothing.</p>",
    "<p>As if Desir could read Criken\u2019s thoughts, he shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating technique, don\u2019t you think? I felt the same way when I saw it for the first time.\u201d Desir lowered himself to his knees, and took Criken\u2019s mask off. Their eyes met.   \u201cAre you curious? I could tell you, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Criken shivered weakly. Of course he was curious. How could he not me? It was an achievement that defied everything everyone knew about magic crystals! A technique decades ahead of its time! If he had this technique, he could take all the riches of the Tower of Magic for himself! And the boy was offering to tell him this secret?</p>",
    "<p>Desir calmly asked again. \u201cDo you want to know?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Criken nodded quickly. The outcome of this fight was irrelevant. His pride was irrelevant. This \u2018technique\u2019 was worth that much.</p>",
    "<p>Desir smiled brightly. \u201cThen, you should pay up for that bread first.\u201d The gravitational pressure increased again, to 12 times.</p>",
    "<p>Criken howled for a moment as pain wracked his body, before he fell unconscious.</p>",
    "<p>Just like that, the Outers\u2019 attack on the Tower of Magic on July 7th ended.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to thank you,\u201d Dr. Prelude gushed to Desir\u2019s party as they sat around the Tower of Magic\u2019s reception hall. \u201cTruly,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe would have suffered a serious, no, perhaps even catastrophic loss had it not been for your party, Mr. Desir. I don\u2019t even want to imagine what would have happened had the Outers succeeded in taking that magic crystal.\u201d Prelude bowed his head in gratitude. \u201cThank you, Mr. Desir. Your party as well.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram barely kept a giggle down as he watched Dr. Prelude speak to Desir from across the table. Not even a half day prior, this person had been treating Desir like he was insane. He\u2019d agreed to listen to Desir because Desir had known about Ruigenell\u2019s Tear, and only on the provision that had the Outers not shown, Desir would\u2019ve had to shoulder all the cost of the defensive preparation. Even then, he hadn\u2019t completely trusted Desir. The looks Desir\u2019s party had caught glances of, right up until the Outers appeared, were truly terrible.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Although, it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t understand his perspective\u2026\u2019 Pram silently decided. In honesty, even he had doubts. The Outers would attack the Tower of Magic out of nowhere? That was considered nothing short of insanity. What kind of crazy idiot would attack the Tower of Magic, the greatest, most powerful corporation in the world? And yet\u2026Pram gulped. \u2018Mr. Desir\u2019s words turned out to be true\u2026\u2019 Just as Desir had said, the Outers had come. And, just as he\u2019d planned, they had been tidily, cleanly swept up. Their leader, Criken, had been arrested, and the 2nd tier magic crystal, Ruigenell\u2019s Tear, had been recovered and placed back under security. In short, Desir\u2019s party had made a miracle happen.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018I\u2019m sorry for ever doubting you, Mr. Desir.\u2019 Silently, Pram resolved to himself to always trust Desir from now on. Pram would never again doubt any of Desir\u2019s decisions, no matter how absurd, how baseless they might seem. He turned to Desir, staring in admiration, boundless faith in his eyes.</p>",
    "<p>Desir, of course, remained oblivious, and continued to talk to Dr. Prelude. \u201cI\u2019m glad we could be of help. Moving on, I\u2019d like to talk about the compensation.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAh, of course, the compensation.\u201d Cause and effect. Work and compensation. Perfectly natural, perfectly understandable. Prelude continued. \u201cOur Tower of Magic will offer you 120 gold in compensation.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica nearly jumped out of her seat, startled. \u201c1\u2014120 gold? Are you serious?\u201d Her tone was incredulous.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Miss Romantica,\u201d Prelude responded smoothly. \u201cConsidering what you\u2019ve done for us, at least this much is fair.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica poked Desir\u2019s side impatiently. \u201cHey, hey, what are you doing! You were complaining about our party\u2019s budget not being sufficient right? If we have this amount of money, we could easily run the party for a year - no, 6 years!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Pram eagerly nodded in agreement. \u201cRight. And we won\u2019t need the Tower of Magic\u2019s sponsorship anymore. We\u2019ll have more than enough money.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Prelude nodded very slightly. Desir had wanted the Tower of Magic\u2019s sponsorship - Prelude had remembered that very well. \u201cWe\u2019d originally been planning to offer 100 gold,\u201d he began explaining, \u201cbut, unfortunately, it seems that your party hadn\u2019t been able to apply for the sponsorship. So I pulled some strings and got the extra 20 gold. It\u2019s not much compared to the Tower of Magic\u2019s sponsorship, but it\u2019s still a good sum.\u201d The coins inside clinked as Prelude set the leather pouch on the table.</p>",
    "<p>Desir didn\u2019t even glance at it as he spoke. \u201cDr. Prelude.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDo you remember what I said at the beginning of our conversation?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAh, yes. I do remember.\u201d Prelude nodded, recalling the conversation they\u2019d had earlier this morning.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAre you perhaps requesting a sponsorship from the Tower of Magic?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a similar request.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir\u2019s voice interrupted Prelude\u2019s memory. \u201cThank you for the offer, but I\u2019ll have to refuse.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWha~!\u201d Beside him, two voices erupted in protest, and angry interjections filled the room. Pram and Romantica, naturally.</p>",
    "<p>Desir ignored their voices, seemingly unfazed. \u201cI don\u2019t want money. Instead, I have a request.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Dr. Prelude pushed his crooked glasses up. \u201cBu - but Mr. Desir, the sponsorship application deadline was July 4th. I know how sincerely you want the Tower of Magic\u2019s support, and I know how much you regret not being able to apply. However, this is a rule that not even Zod himself could change.\u201d Indeed, that had been the practical motivation behind raising the compensation to 120 gold. It had been consolation, of a sort, but, more importantly, it ensured that their party would not be discontent.</p>",
    "<p>Desir sighed in disappointment. \u201cYou misunderstand me again, Dr. Prelude. I have no intention of asking you to pull any strings for the sponsorship. I know very well how much important the Tower of Magic places on timeliness, and how troublesome this would be for you.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Now Prelude was utterly confused. \u201cThen\u2026then what is your request?\u201d he asked incredulously. His expectations had been shattered, and his offers all refused.</p>",
    "<p>When Desir responded, Prelude was surprised at how simple the request was. It was concise, and of course, easily satisfied. It was just that, no matter how much he thought about it, he couldn\u2019t understand why.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cPlease let me play chess with the Master of the Tower of Magic.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>[Altaea, the heart of magic engineering.]</p>",
    "<p>Roads spread across the city like spider webs, and magic-powered cars zipped across them. Around them, titanic buildings soared into the air. It was here that the Tower of Magic, famed as the greatest corporation in the world, had its headquarters.</p>",
    "<p>Across its spacious, elegant hallway strode two figures. Some smiled and greeted as they passed the two, others did a quick double-take in confusion. The two seemed not to mind, and quickly entered an elevator on the far side of the lobby.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIs this really alright, Mr. Desir?\u201d Prelude ventured. With experienced motions, he sent the cylindrical elevator soaring upwards. He turned to the enigmatic child, puzzled. Pram and Romantica had gone sightseeing, so it was simply Desir and Prelude in the elevator.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d replied Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cChess. I\u2019m talking about chess.   You did, truthfully, something incredible, and yet, you\u2019re only asking to play chess\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir shrugged. \u201cEveryone wants something different.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEven so, it\u2019s 120 gold, you know?\u201d Prelude sighed in resignation. \u201cAnd to top it off, what was the Tower Master thinking when he accepted such a bizarre request\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir answered, nonchalantly, as the elevator doors opened. \u201cHe was probably interested just by how out of the ordinary the request was.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>They stepped into a room, with enormous bookshelves lining each of its long walls. Neat lines of textbooks ran, unbroken, across each row, top to bottom, and further countless stacks of books were laid out all over the floor. At the front stood a blackboard with formulas crammed into every corner and blank space, enough to give even a casual reader a headache. Around them, the windows\u2019 curtains had all been drawn, and lamps, containing magic crystals enchanted with light magic, were placed around the room, filling the room with bright light.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018They even use magic crystals for their lamps.\u2019 Desir noted. In the middle of this room sat a man with long lashes and a high nose. Pink lips contrasted his pure white skin, unmarked by blemishes. He had a strong charm with his distinct features. Even by the most pessimistic estimate, he couldn\u2019t have been older than 30.</p>",
    "<p>As he saw Desir enter the room, he smiled, and pushed his glasses up nonchalantly. Desir chuckled to himself. \u2018He still looks the same, huh?\u2019</p>",
    "<p>He was Zod Exarion. In past, present, and Desir\u2019s future, he was the greatest mage in the world, the man who had singled-handedly revived interest in magic. Listing all of his accomplishments was an unenviable feat. They could\u2019ve filled an entire book - in fact, there was actually a book that detailed all of his accomplishments. It had come out earlier this year. It was thicker than most encyclopedias.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought the student,\u201d said Prelude.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cGood work. You may take your leave,\u201d replied Zod. There was an archaic feeling to his words. He gestured in front of him, to an ivory-colored chess board laid atop a black, circular table. \u201cSit.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir sat across from Zod, who peered at the boy through his glasses. \u201cIf I had the time, I would have at least offered you tea, so that we could play a leisurely game together. But, alas, I have a meeting in exactly 27 minutes, and I cannot afford the time.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m thankful enough that you listened to my impudent request,\u201d replied Desir smoothly.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThank you for understanding. Now, let us begin the game.\u201d Zod\u2019s tone almost betrayed the slightest impatience.</p>",
    "<p>There were no other pleasantries to be explained. Chess was the purpose of the meeting, so it was all they talked about.</p>",
    "<p>Zod placed the pieces on the board, and gestured to Desir. \u201cWhich rules would you like to play by? Imperial, or Western Kingdoms?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019ll choose North Sea style.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Zod\u2019s eyes twinkled for a moment.</p>"
