    "<p>Pram wore a light blue apron on top of his clothes, staring intently at Desir. Hot steam billowed out of the teacup he just placed on the table. Pram\u2019s rosy cheeks accented his flush complexion as he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a new type of tea I brewed.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThanks, Pram,\u201d Desir said absentmindedly.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Anyways, what were you thinking about?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHm\u2014what do you mean?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been staring off into space for a while now, without even a glance of your papers.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOh, was I?\u201d Desir was tempted to say \u2018I was thinking about you\u2019, but he held his tongue.</p>",
    "<p>As he prepared to give Pram a sloppy excuse, Romantica prattled \u201cIt\u2019s obvious if you look at him. He was definitely thinking of something stupid.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMr. Desir doesn\u2019t think of stupid things! He\u2019s obviously thinking of something important! Really important! It\u2019s probably something about our party, or incredibly serious!\u201d Pram jumped up in defense of Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Wait! Don\u2019t defend me, Pram!\u2019 He really was thinking of something stupid\u2014and he could never, ever let anybody find out about it.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201d Pram\u2019s eyes, filled with expectation, stroke down at Desir\u2019s heart as he wanted to avert his eyes. He couldn\u2019t betray Pram\u2019s expectations.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI uh\u2014that\u2019s right. Something like that.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSee, Miss Romantica?\u201d In Pram\u2019s eyes, Desir was infallible. He could do no wrong.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica was swayed by Pram\u2019s response. \u201cMm. I suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d She quietly affirmed his opinion and glanced elsewhere.</p>",
    "<p>Desir, feeling guilty, sipped his tea and changed the topic. \u201cThis is delicious, Pram.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOf course! I spent a lot of time brewing it\u2014it\u2019s my secret recipe!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cImpressive. You should write it down for me later.\u201d Pram nodded in agreement and went looking for a sheet of paper to write down the tea recipe. In the meantime, Desir returned to the pile of documents piled in front of him. The vast majority of it was paperwork that came with his position of party leader. As he trudged through the papers, he recalled that it was about time for the Tower of Magic to announce their sponsorships.</p>",
    "<p>Desir glanced at his fellow party members out of the corner of his eyes. After confirming they weren\u2019t looking in his direction, he shifted the documents off to the side and peered onto a sheet of paper on the bottom. This sheet of paper was the reason for his carefully crafted stack of papers. It detailed a timeline of events so that he could better organize his future plans. A few of them were crossed out.</p>",
    "<p>5 Points. Entrance Exam - March 1st</p>",
    "<p>5 Points. Single Ranker Promotion Battle - May 1st</p>",
    "<p>2 Points. Exchange Battle - May 10th-21st Check This</p>",
    "<p>4 Points. Tower of Magic Sponsorship Announcement - July 5th</p>",
    "<p>3 Points. Attack on Tower of Magic\u2019s Aeurelli Branch - July 7th</p>",
    "<p>1 Point. Explosion at Hebrion Academy\u2019s Pharmacy Faculty. 0 Casualties. - Approx July 9th-14th</p>",
    "<p>6 Points. Emergence of the Shadow World - July 20th</p>",
    "<p>Points were assigned based on importance. The more impactful, the more vivid the memory was for Desir. This in turn made the dates clearer for him. On the flip side, there were a few events that had less of an impact, and it was difficult for Desir to recall those dates.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018July 5th\u2014the application date for the Tower of Magic sponsorship is due tomorrow.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Hebrion Academy, being famous as one of the greatest magic academies on the continent, became a breeding ground for countless corporations to advertise their names. Parties would get stronger through sponsorship, and use their newfound power to clear Shadow Worlds. As the party grew, their fame would bolster the reputation of the corporation, so they spared no expense to help foster these parties. The most illustrious of these corporations was the Tower of Magic.</p>",
    "<p>The Tower of Magic.</p>",
    "<p>An international conglomerate that pioneered magical engineering, spanning across multitudes of industries. From military equipment to household products, finances, and education, the Tower of Magic\u2019s influence had no limits. The parties sponsored by the Tower of Magic had access to the most cutting-edge equipment on the market, giving them a significant advantage in clearing Shadow Worlds.</p>",
    "<p>Countless applicants would be willing to pledge themselves to the Tower of Magic, but they were only looking for the best. The Tower of Magic was very peculiar with their sponsorship: they only sponsored one party each year. Any party selected by the Tower of Magic was publicly acknowledged to be filled with potential. With diligent growth, they would become the foundation for humanity\u2019s war against the Shadow World.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018The Tower of Magic\u2026\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Desir\u2019s thoughts brought him back to his previous life. He had deep ties with the Tower of Magic\u2014the Head of the tower was his comrade in arms, Zod Exarion. Age 91, he was a mage who conquered the 6th circle and surpassed the limits of humanity.</p>",
    "<p>Head of the Tower of Magic.</p>",
    "<p>7th Circle Mage.</p>",
    "<p>Great Sage.</p>",
    "<p>Prodigium Magnum.</p>",
    "<p>Leaden with dozens of titles, he stood at the forefront of all magic. And together with Desir, they fought in the Shadow Labyrinth together\u2014the worst Shadow World of them all. The Expedition, a group of over 150 million people were sent in to clear it, with only 6 survivors making it to the end. The two of them both made it to the end, before the incident that sent him spiraling back into the past.</p>",
    "<p>The 7th circle mage was crucial to the Expedition\u2019s quest to defeat the Shadow Labyrinth. His spells swept the landscape and tore down wave after wave of enemies. Their bodies wiped out of existence, without a trace to be found. That in itself was a monumental achievement, but Zod\u2019s true skills lied in his mechanical prowess.</p>",
    "<p>During their travels in the Shadow Labyrinth, Zod\u2019s talents manifested and developed themselves out of necessity. His equipment had bolstered the ability of the Expedition by several fold. \u2018If he weren\u2019t there, we likely wouldn\u2019t have even made it to the end.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Desir was deep in thought. \u2018This is a chance. I was planning on contacting him anyways about \u201cthat\u201d. Getting the Tower of Magic sponsorship is the best case scenario.\u2019 He would put the application in first before contacting Exarion. With that, Desir rose from his seat. He needed to collect the documentation to apply for the Tower of Magic sponsorship. \u2018It is strange that the official documents and application forms still haven\u2019t been sent when there is only a day left\u2026\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Desir felt something tugging at him, but couldn\u2019t place it. According to his memories, Professor Brigitte was the one who took the applications for the Tower of Magic sponsorship. With that in mind, he collected himself and proceeded to head to the Professor\u2019s office.</p>",
    "<p>***</p>",
    "<p>As Desir arrived at the professor\u2019s office, she appeared to be about to leave. \u201cAh, Desir,\u201d said Brigitte with a smile on her face. Seeing him approach, she put her coat back on the hanger and welcomed her student. \u201cGood to see you. I was just on my way to find you myself.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. I didn\u2019t want to waste your time.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWaste my time?\u201d said Brigitte. She looked puzzled at Desir\u2019s words.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m here for the documentation to apply for the Tower of Magic sponsorship,\u201d explained Desir.</p>",
    "<p>Brigitte cocked her head in confusion. She frowned as she responded to Desir. \u201cI think you\u2019ve misunderstood something. I am not the one in charge of the Tower of Magic sponsorship applications. That would be Professor Nifleka.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>She fixed her glasses. \u201cIn all honesty, I was planning on taking care of it all myself, but with him being a stubborn old fart, the headmaster passed on the responsibility to him.</p>",
    "<p>Desir\u2019s eyes opened wide at the news. \u201cHaha\u2014I see. I made a mistake.\u201d Desir laughed awkwardly. \u2018The future has changed.\u2019 Desir always knew that his actions would cause ripples that would change the course of the future as well. \u2018But why Nifleka\u2026\u2019 He started becoming anxious at the news, shaking his head to clear his thoughts. \u201cThat just means I have to get the papers from Professor Nifleka, correct?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the reason I wanted to talk to you, Desir.\u201d Brigitte had a concerned look on her face. \u201cThe application period for the Tower of Magic sponsorship ended yesterday.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir coughed abruptly at the information. He felt like he had been hit on the back of the head.</p>",
    "<p>Based on the shock in Desir\u2019s face, Brigitte figured that something was wrong. \u201cDesir, why didn\u2019t you apply?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHold on, professor. Wasn\u2019t the application deadline July 5th?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Brigitte raised her voice slightly. \u201cIt was July 3rd. Normally, it is the 5th, but we decided during the meeting to move it a few days forward due to the fact that Professor Nifleka had to go overseas. Whatever the case, we did announce that the deadline was July 3rd. I suppose you didn\u2019t check the official announcements.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Wait\u2014official announcements?\u2019 Desir didn\u2019t receive anything of the sort. \u201cI may have a tower of papers, but I still read everything, professor. There wasn\u2019t any announcement. That\u2019s the reason I came looking for you. I thought it was strange we weren\u2019t getting anything.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Professor Brigitte was speechless. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying\u2026\u201d She closed her eyes, her face flush. She rubbed her forehead, as if nursing a headache. \u201cYou\u2019re saying that only our party didn\u2019t get the announcement that was supposed to go out to everybody.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI searched through everything, I swear on it. I didn\u2019t throw anything away, so you can see for yourself.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Brigitte trusted her student. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t lie about this. That means the problem was on the staff side\u2026\u201d Professor Nifleka was in charge. If Desir was telling the truth, he had deliberately skipped sending the announcement to their party. \u201cThat can\u2019t be it. No matter how much you dislike each other, he wouldn\u2019t take such drastic steps.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI believe the same, professor.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Brigitte paused and pursed her lips. \u201cWait a moment. I have to check on something.\u201d She opened the door and left, pulling out her Pad to call somebody. In the office, there was an eerie silence setting in, like the calm before a storm.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cExcuse me!\u201d Brigitte shouted. \u201cContact\u2026not even\u2026 can\u2019t\u2026 responsible\u2026 error? I\u2026 good\u2026 person\u2026 so\u2026 hurt\u2026 don\u2019t hang up\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Bad news.\u2019 He could tell from the tone of her voice. Brigitte clambered back in a moment later, breathing heavily. Her cheeks were flush.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThey said they weren\u2019t able to deliver the announcement. An \u2018administrative error\u2019, he says.\u201d</p>"
