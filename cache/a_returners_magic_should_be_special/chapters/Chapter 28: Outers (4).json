    "<p>Pram had the wind knocked out of his sails by the covert mage. Getting a better look, he realized that the mage was Criken. He had used his subordinates to shield himself and now, his second spell landed square on Pram\u2019s back.</p>",
    "<p>[Doom Fist.]</p>",
    "<p>Soil coagulated into the shape of a fist and struck Pram\u2019s exposed back. \u201cAugh!\u201d Pram screamed from the searing pain. Fresh blood dripped out of his lips, and he stumbled from the stock. Clenching his teeth, he calmed his rough breathing and fixed his posture. With the entrance of the Criken, he had to be more careful with his approach against the veteran mage.</p>",
    "<p>The latter, however, was at ease. \u201cYour skills are impressive, but\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>[Bind.]</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYour experience is lacking.\u201d 1st circle snaring spell. Shackles of mana shot towards Pram. They were sluggish in their pursuit of Pram allowing him to dodge, but they led him straight into Criken\u2019s trap.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHehe.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>[Raise Wall.]</p>",
    "<p>The Bind spell was a feint to lure Pram into the trap. A barrier on 3 sides rose from the ground to surround the boy and wall off his attempts to avoid the flurry of spells being pelted at him. Dozens of spells rained down relentlessly at him, and with nowhere to go, he was forced to parry.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHah!\u201d Pram swung his Blanchume rapier without pause at the torrent of magic being blasted at his location. Burning flames, sharpened icicles, and biting gales were torn to shreds by the silvery blade, and the slightest moment of hesitation would take him down. Even with his highest speed, he could only deflect and disperse magic\u2014the mages would never leave him to opportunity to make an escape.</p>",
    "<p>Criken\u2019s eyes narrowed at the sight of this unknown boy holding out against his contingent of mages. \u2018I\u2019ll get rid of that kid myself in one shot.\u2019 He gathered his mana and formed a 3rd circle spell around him. The magic would eviscerate the swordsman and turn him into ash. He only needed a few more seconds\u2014</p>",
    "<p>Wham! Criken\u2019s attention was distracted as one of his mages fell toward him and knocked him over. His casting formula dissipated as he took a good look at the man who fell down. There was a small hole in his subordinate\u2019s chest plate. He immediately checked his surroundings in a panic. Traces of magic could be found\u2014it was sniping magic.</p>",
    "<p>A swordsman in front of him was downed.</p>",
    "<p>Another two were downed behind him.</p>",
    "<p>Criken bit his lip. If he didn\u2019t fight back now, he would lose the chance. His men were dropping like flies. The tireless barrage of magic on Pram was loosening up and he was gaining momentum. The victory was slipping from his grasp right in front of his eyes. \u2018Sheet.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>\u201cLose? Me?\u201d He silently cursed. \u201cI won\u2019t let it end here!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cUgh!\u201d One of the swordsman took a hit\u2014Criken saw a chance. The fallen subordinate was wailing, but when he looked carefully, the attack didn\u2019t pierce the armor. \u2018The spell couldn\u2019t even pierce the armor\u2014is it a 2nd circle mage?\u2019</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAll of you! Protect me!\u201d commanded Criken.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>He immediately began to prepare a spell. The magic formula manifested rapidly around him and drained an enormous amount of mana from his body. Without the spare mana available, his previous constructs were deteriorating. With the walls out of Pram\u2019s way, the swordsmen sent to suppress him felt a shiver down their spine. Without the wall, it wasn\u2019t even a fight. It was a slaughter.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming!\u201d They trembled in preparation for their fight with the Knight-rank swordsman. But nothing came.</p>",
    "<p>Pram dashed past the swordsmen and instead, wreaked havoc on the mages, now at the complete mercy of a silver flash. The swordsmen found themselves dispatched by formless bolts of sniping magic from outside of their vision. Soon, all that remained was Criken and a lone swordsman.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cCommander?\u201d The swordsman\u2019s face paled as his sword met the weightless blade. It didn\u2019t even last a second before his sword was slashed through. \u201cHelp me, sir!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Criken did not pay him any mind. His magic swirled around him, and completed the spell. A platform of stone fractured and rose into the air with Criken at the epicenter. A wide smile and show of relief appeared on the swordsman\u2019s face, with the utmost faith that his commander would turn the fight on its head. \u201cAs expected, commander! You always have something up your sleeve!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNo\u2026 it\u2019s not that. This is\u2026\u201d Pram grew anxious as he watched Criken weave together this magic. The stone fragments circling Criken began to condense around him and cover him with a sturdy shell. The entire floor had been uprooted, and Pram backed away to safety.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHuh?\u201d The soldier was different. He couldn\u2019t escape from the spell and was raised alongside the floor. \u201cWait, command\u2014\u201d Suddenly, the ground compressed together with him in tow. A bloody crunch echoed out.</p>",
    "<p>A bone-chilling shiver ran down Pram\u2019s spine. He was shocked that this commander would sacrifice his men without batting an eye. Even so, he couldn\u2019t approach due to the magical field else he would suffer the same fate. Once the rock\u2019s reconstruction finished itself, a hexahedron appeared, smooth and refined.</p>",
    "<p>[Bindell of Earth.]</p>",
    "<p>Defensive magic of the highest tier. This was a 4th circle escape spell. The floor that had been used for the spell could no longer hold its own weight and crumbled. Pram managed to barely avoid falling by grabbing onto the rails, but unlike him, the hexahedron began free falling and disappeared into the abyss. He looked helplessly at the location where the hexahedron was just seconds ago.</p>",
    "<p>A location not so far away from the Tower of Magic, the stone floor began to move as if it were breathing. The place reeked of musty and dank smells, and rats skittered away from the tremors. A hexahedron shot out of the ground and found itself in a place away from prying eyes. The hexahedron fell back into dirt as the tall figure emerged from within, holding a magic crystal that shimmered in the darkness of the sewers. Criken sighed. \u201cPhew.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>His forehead was lined with sweat. \u201cReally, I don\u2019t get it. Even if it was the Tower of Magic, there is no way that they have such an expansive information network\u2026\u201d He wiped his brow and once again put on his shark faced mask. \u201cIn any case, our current objective is complete.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>2nd tier magic crystal, Ruigenell\u2019s Tear.</p>",
    "<p>His eyes got lost in the luminescent blue light and he smiled.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat would be correct if you can make it out of here.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Criken jumped and stared down the corridor towards the source of the noise. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI marked you with my mana. It lets me find you in real-time.\u201d Footsteps rang in the hall as a young boy emerged from the shadows. Criken recognized the face\u2014it was the boy who had left with the bread.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHa\u2026\u201d Criken sighed. Relief washed over his face. \u201cYou played me. The situation took so many turns and it nearly flew out of my control. But only for a moment.\u201d He could clearly feel that the boy in front of him only had enough mana to be a 1st circle mage. He extended his hand to construct the magic formula to murder this pesky boy and then\u2014</p>",
    "<p>The formula fell apart. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>He tried again, but the results were the same. It didn\u2019t take long for him to realize that his sequence had been hijacked.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDo you really plan on completing a spell with such a simple formula?\u201d The boy standing in front of him was hijacking his spell. The spell of a 4th circle mage! If Pram or Romantica were here, they would recognize him: Hebrion\u2019s Single Ranker, Desir Arman.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Just how is he overpowering me?\u2019 He could feel that the boy in front of him only had the capacity for 1st circle magic. It was impossible for him to overpower his magic with sheer force\u2014that was reality. If he didn\u2019t see it right before his eyes, he wouldn\u2019t believe it either. His defeat was looming before him.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe have a bit of debt to settle, don\u2019t we? Do you remember that bread that you stomped on?\u201d Desir casually strode towards him, but Criken maintained his distance. He was backed into a corner despite his pride as a 4th circle mage. He was at his wit\u2019s end.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDon\u2019t come any closer!\u201d Criken held out the shining treasure in his palm and threatened Desir. \u201cI\u2019ll shatter it! I\u2019ll shatter it into pieces!\u201d He shouted as if he was on his last legs.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cTry it.\u201d Desir sighed with a pitiful gaze, and shook his head as he spoke.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI said \u2018Try it\u2019.\u201d Desir reiterated the words again.</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026You bastard.\u201d Criken felt heat blow across his face.</p>",
    "<p>Desir inched closer. \u201cYou won\u2019t do it. In the end, you\u2019ve lost so many of your men to get it.\u201d With each sentence, he drew towards Criken. \u201cWhat will you have left after you\u2019ve lost even this?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDon\u2019t get any closer!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir paid no heed to his threats and stood with him face to face. He treated him like a scarecrow.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018This idiot!\u2019 The look of helplessness on Criken\u2019s face transformed into cunning. A faint smile formed on his lips. Despite the overconfidence of the boy in front of him, he didn\u2019t expect him to come so close. If they fought through magic, he believed that Desir would be able to disarm his spells, but in a battle of pure strength, he could defeat him in a physical altercation. Without another word, he swung his fist at the boy.</p>",
    "<p>[Gravity Control.]</p>",
    "<p>4th circle control spell.</p>",
    "<p>Unfortunately for him, Desir\u2019s casting was much faster than the speed of Criken\u2019s fist. His magic formula unfolded rapidly and activated in point-blank range of Criken. Before the man could blink, a massive weight pressed down on him and left him prone on his knees.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cArgh\u2026argh!\u201d Criken struggled with as much as he could under the growing gravitational forces sandwiching him to the floor.</p>",
    "<p>Not long after, the gravity forced him onto the ground. He was completely suppressed. Gravity Control had placed him under 8 times the normal pressure. A hard thud sounded out as Criken was adhered to the ground. Criken\u2019s eyes watered as the stench of the inky sewage water stung his nose.</p>"
