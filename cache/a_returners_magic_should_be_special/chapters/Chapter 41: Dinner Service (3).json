    "<p>As the potatoes simmered in the oven, Jefran swapped over to the steaks. He grabbed a slab of beef from the pantry and tossed it onto the table. \u201cWhat\u2019s the order?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThree well done, five medium, three medium rare, and two rare, chef!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Acknowledging Desir with a curt nod, he turned his attention to the tenderloin. Jefran sliced the beef into generous portions, displaying his culinary mastery. In the middle of his cutting, he glanced back at the potatoes. \u201cThey should be cooked by now. Take them out of the oven, then peel the skin and crush them.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes, chef!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>While Desir went to plate the dishes, Jefran placed his tenderloin steaks onto a skillet, mentoring his protegee with his expertise at the same time. \u201cWhen cooking steaks, focus on the well done and medium steaks first. That way, we can match the cooking time for all of the dishes while they are still hot.\u201d Unlike before, the head chef was amiably passing on his cooking knowledge instead of berating him. Desir listened attentively, looking for any clues and details that might help him clear the Shadow World.</p>",
    "<p>As soon as all of the steaks finished, Jefran put the finishing touches to the plating. Everything had to be served before it got cold.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNow, with the worcestershire sauce and the onions!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>A brilliant rhythmic knocking rapped on the counter; it was Jefran lightly cooking the vegetables and chopping them up into a garnish to accent the dish. He then plated the mashed potatoes and garnished them elegantly, then rang a bell, calling the servers to take the exquisite meal out to his guests. As they were arriving, Jefran started to explain each dish and give them pinpoint instructions. While they took their dishes out, Desir asked the head chef what to do next.</p>",
    "<p>After the main course, it was time for dessert.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to prepare dessert,\u201d said Jefran flatly.</p>",
    "<p>Desir was flabbergasted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt takes quite a bit of time to make a cake, so I made it in advance. You know- I\u2019m a prepared chef. All that\u2019s left to do is slice the cake. Go sit down and take a break. Chef\u2019s orders.\u201d He gave Desir a smile and went back to his work.</p>",
    "<p>Desir sat down in a chair at the corner of the room. After looking around and taking in the room, he started to notice a few smaller details that he had overlooked in the rush. Specifically, one thing in particular caught his eye.</p>",
    "<p>A couple of plump, oval-shaped green fruits sat in a basket on the table. Not a single one was used within the entire meal. Desir turned to ask Jefran a question. \u201cChef, do you like plums?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHm- you mean these? Yeah, that\u2019s what they\u2019re called, aren\u2019t they. You sure know your stuff, boy. The higher ups sent them over saying I should try to use \u2018em, but they taste bitter. It\u2019s such a shame, what with their nice fragrance. I was about to throw \u2018em away.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u2018I see\u2026 so that\u2019s what it is.\u2019 Jefran inadvertently answered his question; Desir checked the plums to ensure that they were still fresh and fragrant. \u2018This fruit must be related to the quest.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>If there was an object related to the Shadow World, quests would promptly pop up. Desir thought carefully about the plum. It was just a leftover ingredient in the kitchen, something left there because the chef didn\u2019t know what to do with it. \u2018He even gave me a hint.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Jefran commented about how it had a nice fragrance, but a bitter taste- meaning, the hint was to utilize its fragrance. Casual remarks like these would become hints that led to clearing the Shadow World. \u2018Now that humanity can clear Shadow Worlds consistently, it\u2019s offering an opportunity to exceed expectations and finish side quests.\u2019 As soon as he finished his thought, an announcement rung:</p>",
    "<p>| Hidden Quest: \u2018Dinner Service-EX\u2019 found.</p>",
    "<p>| Head Chef Jefran does not know anything about plums and they do not grow locally. You must lead him with your culinary expertise. Find a way to use the plums.</p>",
    "<p>| If the Earl likes your cooking, additional rewards will be offered.</p>",
    "<p>| If the Earl dislikes your cooking, there may be consequences.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cChef, do you have any plans to serve tea with the dessert?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Jefran looked at Desir and stopped slicing the cake. \u201cI need to prepare it. Unfortunately, the guests don\u2019t seem to like my choice of tea, so I have to think about what to do with it.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we use this?\u201d Desir gestured towards the plums.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe plums? You know how to use these? Hmm\u2026\u201d The head chef looked concerned.</p>",
    "<p>| Jefran\u2019s impression of you is currently [favorable]. Due to this, Jefran will make a positive decision.</p>",
    "<p>Jefran inhaled a deep breath. \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll leave this one to you. Tell me what other ingredients you need to prepare the tea.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes chef! Thank you chef!\u201d Desir recalled the ingredients needed for plum tea using the recipe that Pram gave him. \u2018After we clear the Shadow World, I\u2019ll get Pram something tasty.\u2019</p>",
    "<p>| You have successfully served the dinner service, as well as displaying a personal dish.</p>",
    "<p>| EX Quest Unlocked!</p>",
    "<p>| The Earl knows your name. The following sub-quests will be skipped:</p>",
    "<p>Cooking Quest</p>",
    "<p>Cleaning Quest 1</p>",
    "<p>Cleaning Quest 2</p>",
    "<p>Dish Washing Quest</p>",
    "<p>Later that night, Desir stayed in the kitchen to wash the dishes. The assistant chef was responsible for cleaning up, and the clanking of the dishes emanated throughout the silent kitchen. Jefran was also there taking stock of the ingredients to be used for tomorrow\u2019s dinner. Abruptly, he asked Desir if the tea was an original dish.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNo. I learned it from a friend.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cRegardless, can you make that tea again, so long as you have the ingredients?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes chef, but why are you asking about this? Did the Earl fall in love with my tea, unable to part from it?\u201d asked Desir with a teasing voice.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cQuit running your mouth.\u201d Jefran smacked Desir\u2019s head. Seeing his protegee rub his head in pain, Jefran chuckled and told Desir to sit down. \u201cYou\u2019re right. The Earl liked your tea and requested more.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>| Success! For clearing the EX quest, you have been granted the position of [Assistant]. As an [Assistant], you will receive hints for future quests.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWill I still be able to work here if I served him full time?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou probably wouldn\u2019t have the time. I\u2019ll have to find somebody else.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. I don\u2019t want to get hit again.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>With his large palm, Jefram smacked Desir\u2019s back and gave a hearty laugh.</p>",
    "<p>| Jefran liked your joke. Relationship with Jefran increased to [Trustworthy].</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you this so you don\u2019t get the wrong idea. You\u2019re not being hired because the tea was amazing. It was fairly standard, but the Earl liked the novelty. He\u2019s never tasted anything like it before. If that\u2019s the case, what should you be doing?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI will try my best to serve the greatest tea, chef!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Always remember that.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes, chef.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Jefran stood up. \u201cGood. Don\u2019t worry about the dishes and go to bed. You\u2019ll need to wake up early tomorrow. That merchant that stocks up on plums is leaving tomorrow morning. It\u2019s only natural to personally select ingredients for your dish.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>| Due to [Head Chef] Jefran\u2019s high opinion of you, he has recommended you to the Earl, stressing your honesty and talent for the [Assistant] position. Your occupation has changed to [Assistant]. The quality of food provided to you will improve. You can freely move around the castle.</p>",
    "<p>The next morning, the two chefs rode in the carriage out of the castle, following the winding path. Autumn was nearing its end and frost was starting to creep up on the ends of the greenery. Leaning towards the shaking window, Desir looked outside.</p>",
    "<p>From a chimney, white smoke billowed above a roof. The streets were well kept and after passing the drawbridge, a city came into view. Under the current governing system, the city was flourishing and there was a lively hustle and bustle everywhere they went. While Desir and the Earl had never met, he was convinced that the Earl had to be a splendid ruler.</p>",
    "<p>As they traveled, Desir began noticing something odd\u2026 the smiles on the faces of the people faded the further they got from the city center. After traveling past the residential district, they passed the plains with small huts made of wood. The livelihood of the city vanished in an instant. The people here looked exhausted, their faces laced with dirt and grime.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMr. Jefran, what is this place?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Jefran clicked his tongue. \u201cA village for wanderers. Recently, we have been taking in wanderers who don\u2019t have a place to stay.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s peculiar. I\u2019ve never seen an Earl accept so many wanderers.\u201d They were people from all walks of life; some had circumstances which caused them to lose their homes, others had been exiled. The only thing that bound them together was this: they didn\u2019t have any place to stay. Typically, nobody in the right mind would accept so many nomads- there were almost as many of them as there were residents of the inner city.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOur Earl is generous. At first, there were only a few and his Lordship offered them sanctuary. Soon after, rumors spread across the land and here we are now. Regardless of the cautionary tales of his advisors, he\u2019s insistent on supporting them until the end of Winter. As you know, the Winter\u2019s brutal. If we kick them out now, it\u2019s no different from sending them to their graves.\u201d Jefran shivered and rubbed his palms together. He took a parting glance at the men and women huddling together for warmth outside.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI get it. Nobody wants blood on their hands. But I don\u2019t like it. We\u2019re short enough on food as it is, and these guys do nothing but steal our food. Eh\u2026 you know what I mean. There\u2019s plenty of people around here who feel the same.\u201d Jefran hacked out some spit.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI see.\u201d Desir let out a heavy sigh. \u2018It\u2019s just like the Academy- the civilians and nomads are just like the Alpha and Beta students.\u2019</p>"
