    "<p>Ajest elaborated further. \u201cHe\u2019s almost reached his goal already. He leads Hebrion\u2019s strongest party and is a candidate for the headmaster\u2019s position. The majority of the Alpha Class students support him. All he\u2019s waiting for is for the current dean to step down.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou speak as if you know him very well.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest bit her lip. \u201cThat is\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Elheim didn\u2019t pry any further, and sighed. \u201cIn any case, Professor Nifleka becoming headmaster will result in a slew of potential problems. He might even repeat the actions of Duke Nifleka from over a decade ago.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>12 years ago, the Nifleka family was a mere count\u2019s family, but during the conflict between the Republic and the monarchy, they rapidly rose in status to become a duchy.</p>",
    "<p>Count Nifleka personally led a troupe of knights into the Republic-controlled capital and slaughtered all of the rebels before reclaiming the city in the name of the Crown. Afterward, he was hailed as a savior of the country and granted the title of Duke. During his crusade, 80,000 people had died under his tyranny. He would massacre any commoner suspected of aiding the Republic\u2014man, woman, or child. Even today, the name Duke Nifleka was the subject of great fear.</p>",
    "<p>Suddenly, a gruff voice called out to the pair from the direction of the party. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you two.\u201d Professor Nifleka showed himself from behind the door.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI just wanted some fresh air,\u201d said Elheim.</p>",
    "<p>Nifleka smiled at Elheim\u2019s words. \u201cI see, but you shouldn\u2019t vacate the party, Elheim. There are so many young ladies who have come specifically to meet you. Ah\u2014the lady of the Redwen family was anxiously looking for you. With that in mind, I suggest you make your way back to the party.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI see I have made a lady wait. It would be my pleasure to keep her company.\u201d agreed Elheim.</p>",
    "<p>Just as he was about to pass Nifleka and return to the party, the professor grabbed his shoulder and pulled him close. \u201cAh\u2014there\u2019s one other thing I must tell you. As a professor\u2026\u201d Nifleka\u2019s eyes narrowed and voice dropped to the sound of a whisper. \u201cYou should know when to keep your mouth shut, Triquincy.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>He spoke not to Elheim, the 4th Circle Magician, but to Triquincy, a representative of his house of nobility. A warning.</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026I understand.\u201d Elheim nodded in response and left the terrace, leaving only Ajest and Nifleka in the brisk weather.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt is disrespectful to speak so carelessly. You would do best to watch your words,\u201d said Nifleka, visibly upset.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI only spoke the truth,\u201d responded Ajest.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cTruth or not, you should first consider our relationship. Acting like this would do no good for either of us. Our families are quite close\u2014the savior\u2019s family, Nifleka\u2026 the royal family, Roguepalace.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest Kingscrown\u2014no. Ajest Roguepalace\u2019s eyes shook.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cTry as you might, it is impossible to separate an individual from their family, Ajest. Family is key. One\u2019s family determines one\u2019s life\u2014whether it be position, status, or network. Ah, yes. Another example would be marri\u2014\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Nifleka didn\u2019t continue. It was because a frigid storm had filled the terrace, threatening to freeze the sweat off of his skin. Seeing her expression, he quickly switched the topic. \u201cIn any case, please watch what you say about other families. Would you be taking responsibility if the party is ruined?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019d be better if this meaningless party was.\u201d Ajest spoke crudely.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMeaningless? I told you. This party is\u2014\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis party is just a gathering meant to showcase how the Tower of Magic acknowledged your party as the strongest. But the truth is that Desir\u2019s party, who you tried so hard to defeat, hadn\u2019t even applied for the sponsorship.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>As soon as he heard that, Nifleka\u2019s raised his voice. \u201cHm? I hadn\u2019t heard. But why would I have to know everything that\u2019s going on with that commoner?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAre you feigning ignorance? You changed the application period at your own whim, and neglected to inform Desir\u2019s party about it.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201c</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou were afraid.\u201d She continued, not even blinking at his half-hearted retorts. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been outspoken against commoners, and you didn\u2019t want to seem incompetent losing to those very people that you love to hate.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cFirst off!\u201d Nifleka\u2019s voice shook as he addressed Ajest. \u201cFirst off, this would have never happened if you had won against Desir\u2019s party!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that this is because of me?\u201d asked Ajest.</p>",
    "<p>Nifleka nodded fiercely. \u201cYes! This is all because of you! You lost to Desir\u2019s party! How dare you have the gall to speak up against me after losing in such an unsightly fashion!\u201d Nifleka built up his own momentum in response. \u201cUnfair? Afraid? Ajest Roguepalace! Do you think you of all people have the right to say that to me? You\u2019re nothing but a failure.\u201d His face was beet red. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to blame me, I want you out of this party immediately! At least I won! You lost! The Blue Moon party doesn\u2019t need losers!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest took a good look at Nifleka as he panted heavily. \u2018So all along, I\u2019ve been in a party led by this kind of man.\u2019 She felt the last bit of hesitation fade away\u2014after all, it hadn\u2019t been her decision to join this party in the first place.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t, can you? You can\u2019t leave, right? Quit the bullsheet and return to the party, right now!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest suddenly recalled what Nifleka had said about how family decided everything. She agreed with most of it\u2014it was true that she had originally joined the Blue Moon party to bolster the relationship between Nifleka and Roguepalace. It wasn\u2019t strange for nobles to use their children to form bonds. But was this really a party? As Ajest asked herself this question, her fingers were already reaching for the Blue Moon badge and relinquishing it from her chest.</p>",
    "<p>After Ajest left the terrace, Nifleka was still fuming over the conversation. A call came from his Pad, and he wasn\u2019t in the mood to answer it. He had a grimace over his face at the thought of Ajest, but he straightened up immediately after seeing that the call was from the Tower of Magic.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAh. You\u2019re from the Tower of Magic. How can I help you?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u2014 \u201cSomething urgent has come up, so we will have to take our leave.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cLeaving so soon? A pity, but if it is urgent, I won\u2019t keep you. Have a good night.\u201d Nifleka\u2019s voice was tinged with disappointment.</p>",
    "<p>\u2014 \u201cWe shall definitely come to your next party.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThank you kindly.\u201d A faint smile tugged at the man\u2019s lips.</p>",
    "<p>\u2014 \u201cHave a good night.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>As the conversation ended and Professor Nifleka was about to end the call, he heard some faint whispers before the man spoke again.</p>",
    "<p>\u2014\u201cAh. Professor Nifleka. The Tower of Magic has recently appointed a new technical advisor. I was just wondering if you knew anything about the matter.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The Tower of Magic\u2019s magic engineering was top class. To be a technical advisor, they would have to be one of the greatest minds in the world. Nifleka made some casual remarks about the matter. \u201cHow could I possibly know about the inner workings of an illustrious place like the Tower of Magic? Surely, you would know more than I.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u2014 \u201cAh\u2014it\u2019s because the new technical advisor is apparently from Hebrion Academy.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Professor Nifleka was delighted. \u201cIs that so? Technical advisor for the Tower of Magic. Surely incredible. Are they an alumni of Hebrion Academy? What year did they graduate?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u2014 \u201cBased on my sources, they say he\u2019s still attending Hebrion Academy.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAttending? That\u2019s astonishing! To think that a student could become a technical advisor for the Tower of Magic. Who could he be?\u201d Nifleka pressed on, unable to control himself. He needed to recruit this child into his party as soon as possible.</p>",
    "<p>\u2014 \u201cThis is\u2026 His name is\u2026 Give me a second.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cStop beating around the bush!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u2014 \u201c\u2026There we go. His name is written here. Desir Arman. 1st year at Hebrion Academy, Desir Arman.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>July 8th. 13 days until the Emergence of the Shadow World.</p>",
    "<p>Desir spoke to his two party members in the training room. \u201cBoth of you should have grasped your weaknesses while fighting against the Outers at the Tower of Magic.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWeaknesses?\u201d asked Pram.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Weaknesses. First, Pram. Your experience is lacking.\u201d Experience\u2014time spent in combat, and their ability to fluidly adapt to a situation. Pram had the fundamentals, but he was caught off guard by veterans on the battlefield.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDuring our defense, there was a high-circle mage in the fight, but you were so distracted by the enemies in front of you that you failed to pinpoint both his location and his magic. Thus, you failed. Without Romantica watching your back, you would have definitely been in danger.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026You\u2019re right. I had no idea what to do.\u201d Pram understood his weaknesses, which was a good sign. This meant that he just needed to fix them.</p>",
    "<p>From there, Desir turned to face his second party member. \u201cAnd now, Romantica.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMhm.\u201d Romantica hunched herself over, bracing herself for a slew of criticism.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou did everything that you possibly could,\u201d said Desir.</p>",
    "<p>This caught Romantica off guard, as she was expecting a lot of harsh critique. She immediately straightened herself, and haughtily looked at Desir. \u201cHaha! Of course! How hard do you think I was working?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not a compliment. What I\u2019m saying is that you did well for your level. Your circle. To be specific, the level of a 2nd circle mage. As a sniper, you must aim for the enemy\u2019s weakness, but 2nd circle is too low. As a Single Ranker now, you have to climb higher.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just reach 3rd circle that easily\u2026\u201d complained Romantica. A 3rd circle mage was officially called a \u2018battle mage\u2019\u2014 recognized as a true mage at the level of Hebrion Academy\u2019s graduates.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNow that we\u2019ve pointed out our weaknesses, it\u2019s time for some questions.\u201d Desir smiled playfully. \u201cIf you have a weakness, you should remedy it: yes or no?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOf course you\u2026 should.\u201d A chill ran down Romantica\u2019s spine as she answered Desir. Was it deja vu? She could swear that this had happened before\u2026</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo, in order to remedy that weakness, you should train: yes or no?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou\u2014you should,\u201d Pram gulped. The way Desir was asking questions was unnerving.</p>",
    "<p>And of course, their greatest fears came to life. \u201cPerfect! I\u2019m glad to see that you agree! From now on, we\u2019ll be starting our Hell training. Assemble at the office every day before and after classes!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou monster! Exams are right around the corner!\u201d shrieked Romantica. Her complaints fell on deaf ears, and her screams echoed out into the halls.</p>"
