    "<p>Even in the winter, many residents roamed the streets, basking in the sun. Ajest walked towards a street filled with vendors, stopping in front of a particular stall. As she approached, the surprised stall owner warmly greeted her. \u201cOh my! Isn\u2019t that our captain? Welcome!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you many times. No need to be so formal.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cShh\u2026 and you don\u2019t need to be so modest. Thank you for keeping our streets safe.\u201d The stall owner handed Ajest some of the cookies from her shop. Ajest tried to pay her for the treats, but the stall owner politely declined.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHow could I accept money from our protector?\u201d Realizing that she couldn\u2019t reject her goodwill, Ajest gladly accepted the cookies and thanked her for the trouble. The stall owner turned and called out to Desir, who was standing quite a ways behind Ajest. \u201cAnd here are some for Mr. Boyfriend.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir sputtered out \u201cBoyfriend?\u201d before the shop owner had some choice words to say to him.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAt your age, it\u2019s all over your face,\u201d she snickered. \u201cPlease take care of our captain. She\u2019s a kind-hearted person.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir raised his half and was ready to deny it. \u201cAh, I\u2014\u201c</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThank you for looking after my lover.\u201d Ajest quickly cut in and gave the stall owner a simple thanks.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHah! Captain, you are more of a man than he is!\u201d She giggled to herself as the unlikely pair departed from her stall.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAjest, what are you saying?!\u201d Desir\u2019s face was flush from embarrassment.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m not heartless enough to reject their good intentions.\u201d As Desir opened his mouth to speak again, he was swiftly silenced by Ajest. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to waste time explaining every little thing.\u201d She took off; in her mind, it was a sign that the conversation was over. She bit into the cookie and snapped it in half, offering the remaining portion to \u2018her significant other\u2019.</p>",
    "<p>The cookie itself wasn\u2019t sweet; it tasted like baked flour. It was most likely because it was hard to find sugar. Even so, it wasn\u2019t that bad at all. As they continued down the street, they attracted attention everywhere they went. Gifts of food piled up and soon enough, it was starting to be difficult to carry it all. \u201cLet\u2019s take a short break,\u201d suggested Desir.</p>",
    "<p>In the central plaza, a statue of a stallion reared its head in a regal fashion. Desir and Ajest sat down on a set of benches to catch their breath. The skies were clear and the two of them glanced at each other before averting their gaze. With a bit of hesitation, Ajest asked him a question. \u201cDesir. What is your impression of the streets?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good place. The people are nice and lively.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear.\u201d Her golden locks framed her light red cheeks as she let out a sigh of relief. Desir thought to himself that Ajest was becoming more expressive. She turned over to meet his eyes and creases appeared on her forehead. \u201cYou asked me how the quest was progressing, right?\u201d Desir nodded in response. \u201cI mainly focused on resolving the issue of public safety. As you know, the vagrants were causing a lot of trouble. Due to the influx of vagrants, the morale was low.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSplitting the territory into districts, I have divvied out the knights to each district to maintain order. Severe crimes were punished on the spot, while lesser criminals were transferred to a holding cell.\u201d Desir marveled at what Ajest managed to achieve in a short time. Her strategy was superb. With this method, each district could be policed and managed appropriately.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBut alas, I could not get to the heart of the problem.\u201d Ajest gazed off at the people in the streets. Evernatten residents taking a stroll through the town centre. Children having a snowball fight in the snow banks. The atmosphere was warm, and there was a thrum of life filling the air.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhile moderate crimes declined sharply, it has been difficult to prevent numerous petty crimes, such as robbery and pick-pocketing.\u201d Ajest directed her eyes towards a back alley, there were vagrants skulking about. \u201cThe overall progression has stalled at 30%. Even if public order improved, the quest wouldn\u2019t proceed any further from here on out.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>In the back alley, a vagrant man had his eyes intensely focused on a woman, marking her with his eyes. Holding his breath and blending in with the alley, he ambushed her and tried to steal her bag. The woman cried out in panic, but she couldn\u2019t chase the young man who was already several paces away. Ajest, catching a wind of the robbery, pointed towards the youth\u2019s foot and cast magic.</p>",
    "<p>[Ice]</p>",
    "<p>A coat of ice formed instantaneously, and the young man lost his balance. Windmilling his arms to maintain balance, he found it all to be futile as he slipped and dropped the woman\u2019s bag. Moments later, knights arrived at the scene of the crime to prevent him from running away. Ajest, seeing that the criminal had been properly dealt with, turned to leave.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf I find some clues, I\u2019ll come to visit you again,\u201d said Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d As she left him with her parting words, she descended into the dark alley and headed straight towards the vagrant that was being beaten to the floor. After confirming his arrest, Desir headed back toward the castle.</p>",
    "<p>What\u2019s is the Shadow World?</p>",
    "<p>The Shadow World is a fragment of history.</p>",
    "<p>Meaning, it will repeat once again what has happened in the past.</p>",
    "<p>There were multiple ways to clear a quest in the Shadow World. One was to correct the wrong decisions made by the pivotal figures in the story line. They could clear the quest by leading history through its proper path. The pivotal figure in this Shadow World was Wilhelm Evernatten. He must have spent years searching for a solution to the current problems in his territory, but history proved that the end results had left something to be desired. He needed to obtain more information, and the first step was to gain a better understanding of Wilhelm himself. Not the superficial features, but the private matters that spurred him into action. Thankfully for him, he knew a person who was very familiar with Wilhelm.</p>",
    "<p>That night, Desir knocked on the kitchen door. He sneaked inside and got in touch with his old master, Jefran. \u201cWant me to tell you about the lord? Why are you asking me that?\u201d A thunderous chop landed on the cutting board as the chef cleanly chopped large chunks of meat. Desir\u2019s eyes grew wide with fascination at Jefran\u2019s knife skills. They were fast and precise, slicing the pieces to the perfect size.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI want to know more about the lord from another perspective. Please don\u2019t play dumb with me, Jefran.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The head chef tried to play it off, but the moment he barged into the lord\u2019s room resonated in his mind. \u201cYou little twerp. You should really forget about petty things like that.\u201d Jefran cursed under his breath at his protege\u2019s persistence.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cMister Jefran, the onions are done!\u201d Lilica stood with her arms crossed triumphantly and awaited further instructions from Jefran.</p>",
    "<p>Jefran smiled cheekily at Lilica\u2019s cheerful personality. \u201cOkay, you can leave them there. Good job!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBrother Desir, help me move this pot over there,\u201d asked Lilica. Desir moved the pot filled to the brim with sauce over to where Lilica directed.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cEugh\u2026 it\u2019s not really something I want to talk about, but I guess it\u2019s fine\u2026\u201d Jefran mumbled under his breath. \u201cLilica! Desir will take care of the cooking for tonight. Go get a good night\u2019s rest.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes, Chef!\u201d Lilica saluted at Jefran and thanked Desir, before skipping out of the kitchen with a cheerful smile on her face. Desir had his jaw dropped at the entire exchange.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHeh. You thought it was free? Now boy. Start stirring that soup.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Damn it.\u2019 With a deep sigh, Desir began to follow Jefran\u2019s orders. As usual, it was exhausting.</p>",
    "<p>Jefran started seasoning the meat, and slowly lapsed into his story. \u201cI\u2019ve known Wilhelm for years; we\u2019d first met in the Holy City. During that time, he was a cardinal.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir\u2019s eyes bulged. \u201cA cardinal?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The head chef reminisced and his eyes glazed over. \u201cWell \u2014 back then, I was running a small restaurant. After tasting my dish, Wilhelm asked me if I wanted to be his exclusive chef. What with the little money I had to spare, I immediately accepted his offer. Little did I know, I would have the same look that you\u2019ve got on your face when I finally heard about it as well. Hey, can you go stir the soup?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes, Chef.\u201d Desir rolled up his sleeves and started stirring the soup. \u201cWas he always so cold and aloof?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNope. Wilhelm had a bright personality. By the time the night rolled around, he would go to the bar and drink to his heart\u2019s content. Most people could hardly believe he was a cardinal.\u201d Jefran took a sip of his tea. \u201cI can see the look on your face. You don\u2019t believe it either, right? But I\u2019m telling the truth. He was a very lively person who loved to drink and play. On the nicer days, you could see him practicing swordsmanship with his knights.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>With each word that spilled out of Jefran\u2019s mouth, you could hear regret and sorrow fill his voice. \u201cWilhelm\u2019s talents extended past his knighthood, being a great leader to his men. Leading his knights, he actively fought against the Judgement.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Judgement. At the time, the Holy Nation referred to the Shadow Worlds as Judgement.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThose were the golden days. He never lose a single battle, and thanks to him, the Holy Nation was able to stave off Goddess Artemis\u2019 Judgement.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Unlike the modern era, who had years of history to build the foundation for fighting the Shadow Worlds, this era was forced to build their foundation from scratch. Successfully clearing a Shadow World was an amazing feat. A unique individual whose heroics staved off the Shadow World\u2019s erosion.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cFor the record, over half of the knights in the territory followed him here from the Holy City. Even after he was dismissed, their loyalty led them to follow him here.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNo wonder the knights are so talented\u2026 but why was his dismissed with his accolades?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHe found himself at odds with the newly appointed royalty.\u201d Desir could tell from the trembling in Jefran\u2019s voice that this was around when everything began to change. \u201cHis Majesty wanted to accept the Judgement. If you read the original text from the Church of Artemis, \u2018It is proper to accept the Judgement rather than stop it. The Judgement exists due to our wrongdoing. The Goddess is in the right to punish us for our sins.\u2019\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cTo accept it\u2026 did they mean to completely destroy the Holy Nation?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf that is what the Goddess desires,\u201d lamented Jefran. Desir became stiff. He couldn\u2019t understand how they could resign themselves to such a fate. \u201cOf course, Wilhelm opposed the idea. He always, always, put the people first. You can tell by how he accepts the vagrants. Until the very end, Wilhelm argued that we owe it to the people to fight against the Judgement\u2014 and trust me, that ended poorly. He was stripped of his achievements and ousted from his title. His unit disbanded and he was banished from the capital. Isn\u2019t it a strange fate?\u201d Jefran let out a shallow laugh.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cTake good care of the lord, Desir.\u201d</p>"
