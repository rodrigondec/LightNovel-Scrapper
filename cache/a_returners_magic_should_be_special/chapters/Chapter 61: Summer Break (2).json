    "<p>Hot and humid. It was the last Friday of the semester.</p>",
    "<p>The students of Hebrion Academy were in high spirits, summer break was almost here! Amidst this boisterous atmosphere, a magic class was about to be in session. Desir entered the classroom and looked around. He could see that Ajest and Romantica were already seated. Pram was not present. As this was a magic class, it was not part of Pram\u2019s curriculum.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cGood morning Desir.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYes, good morning.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>After exchanging greetings, Desir stacked his books on a desk next to Romantica and sat down.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou look tired, did you get any sleep?\u201d asked Romantica, noticing the dark circles around Desir\u2019s eyes.</p>",
    "<p>Desir yawned, \u201cI got up really early because I had a nightmare.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cA nightmare? Well aren\u2019t you a special snowflake. You\u2019ve appeared many times in my nightmares.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite an honour. What do I do in your nightmares?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou were the Devil King.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re tired, why don\u2019t you eat this? You\u2019ll get in big trouble if you doze off during Professor Brigette\u2019s lecture.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, thanks.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica held out a mint. Desir took it and popped it in his mouth. The cool taste spread over his tongue and throat, instantly making Desir feel more awake. There was still five minutes before class started. Desir turned to talk to Ajest and Romantica.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSummer break is about to start. Do you two have anything special planned?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI don\u2019t particularly. I\u2019m thinking of staying at the academy,\u201d replied Ajest. This lined up with Desir\u2019s memory. Ajest had always stayed at the academy.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of returning to my hometown. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen my parents. I do write to them, but it\u2019s still good to see them once in a while,\u201d said Romantica.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAh, that works out then. Your hometown is in the Prilecha Kingdom right?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, the scenery there is very beautiful.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Prilecha Kingdom. It was a small country with little territory and a small military to match. However, it had become one of the powerhouses within the Western Kingdom through economic means.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cGood, that works out then,\u201d repeated Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhy? What are you planning this time?\u201d Romantica had an uneasy feeling as to  where the conversation was going.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI have something in mind for us for the summer break. Fortunately, it doesn\u2019t seem like it will get in the way of anybody\u2019s plans.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDid you even listen to what I said? I\u2019m pretty sure I said I was going back to my hometown.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSo,\u201d continued Desir, \u201cour party will be heading to the Prilecha Kingdom this summer. I\u2019ll say this again when we see Pram, but the Golden Ocean Tournament will be held in the Prilecha Kingdom. We will be entering that tournament.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The Golden Ocean Tournament. A famous event where young adults competed against each other in combat. Whether it be with magic or the blade, adolescents confident in their abilities could compete without restriction.</p>",
    "<p>This tournament was famous in other countries as well. If you ask anyone what the Prilecha Kingdom was known for, they would give one of three answers: its markets, the beautiful coastline, or the Golden Ocean Tournament.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf it\u2019s the Golden Ocean Tournament, there will be talented people from all over the world! I don\u2019t think we\u2019d do well,\u201d remarked Romantica pessimistically.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou should be proud of your skills. It\u2019s not common for someone your age to be a third circle mage.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOh well that\u2026\u201d Romantica puffed out her chest, \u201cthat\u2019s just innate talent!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHaving confidence is good, but don\u2019t get too carried away. Ajest here is also a third circle mage and Zod, the head of the Magic Tower, accomplished this achievement when he was 3 years younger than you.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Hearing that, Romantica lowered her gaze.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIf our party does well in the tournament, it\u2019ll improve our reputation and that will help us in the future.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIndeed\u2026doing well in a tournament that is famous in multiple countries\u2026it would certainly be a good thing,\u201d said Ajest, nodding her head in agreement. Romantica also voiced her support.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great! If we were to win, we\u2019ll never be brushed off as a mere commoners party again, will we? I\u2019ve always wanted to try it once.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYeah. We just need to ask Pram as well.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>They needed to hurry, as the entry deadline was soon. The Golden Ocean Tournament was starting in 3 weeks.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIn the meantime,\u201d said Romantica happily, \u201cwe can rest! I don\u2019t know when we last got a break.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>However, Desir was having none of it.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat are you talking about Romantica? We\u2019re training after class today as well.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe need to keep up our training.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOi, do we really have to? Did you forget that, thanks to me, we cleared the Shadow World?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat was then, this is now.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBut\u2026!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t forgotten our contract, have you?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The contract: Members will follow the orders of the party leader. Especially when it comes to training.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDirty scammer!\u201d shouted Romantica, coyly turning away with a scoff.</p>",
    "<p>In that instant, Desir saw something overlapping his vision. His ear felt numb, there seemed to be shouts coming from nowhere. Desir stared hard at Romantica.</p>",
    "<p>An eviscerated torso. Gushing blood. Desir felt as though his heart was being crushed.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat? Why are you staring at me like that?\u201d Romantica\u2019s voice brought Desir back to reality.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018This time definitely\u2026\u2019 Desir tightly squeezed his eyes shut for a brief moment before opening them again.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cRomantica, we\u2019re doing double training today.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhaaaaat!?\u201d replied Romantica, losing it, \u201cHold on, don\u2019t tell me this is because I just called you a dirty scammer?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir did not reply and instead began flipping through his books.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cPardon me, Mr. Desir. I\u2019m sorry. Some vile words slipped out of this young lady\u2019s tongue. Please forgive this innocent girl. Ah, Wait! Desir! Where are you going!?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir collected his books and moved to a seat at the front of the room next to Ajest. Romantica panicked and tried to follow. However\u2026</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHello everyone! What a wonderful morning to study magic!\u201d announced Professor Brigette as she entered the room. Romantica could do nothing except give Desir her best puppy dog eyes from afar.</p>",
    "<p>***</p>",
    "<p>The Hebrion auditorium was made of stone and, during the summer, was very hot and humid, especially at noon. There were many people gathered in the auditorium. Most were students, but there were some teachers gathered there as well. The crowd was quite noisy.</p>",
    "<p>Justin, the headmaster of Hebrion Academy, made his way up to the lectern and turned on the switch for the loudspeaker. As he took a deep breath, a wave of silence swept through the entire auditorium in an instant. The headmaster coughed for a moment and then opened his mouth.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThere are many scientists as well as many magicians. The magic system developed by Rockhilt has become the basis for modern magic and Zod\u2019s development of enchantment magic has opened a new path for mankind. Many scientists and magicians have contributed to humanity and, as a result, mankind has survived the scourge known as the Shadow Worlds.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Justin paused for a breath before continuing.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI am sure that you, too, have contributions to make. I have every confidence that anyone here could be the next Rockhilt or Zod. The Hebrion Academy, this continent\u2019s most prestigious and largest magic academy, will provide all of its support to you.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>He looked out to the faces of the students before him. The students bore a variety of reactions: bored, happy, excited, indifferent\u2026</p>",
    "<p>Children will be children. The headmaster smiled, thinking to himself this ancient adage.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019ll wrap up my speech now. Let the Hebrion Academy summer break begin.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The auditorium erupted with the sounds of departure, the student body disappearing like the receding tide.</p>",
    "<p>After the speech, Desir\u2019s party gathered. They all looked very tired, Romantica, Ajest, Pram and Desir. Unlike the other party members, Romantica was pulling along a very large suitcase. With Desir, Pram, and Ajest staying at the Academy, she was the only one in the group leaving.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThanks for this week.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIt was all for you Romantica. The stronger you become, the more effectively you can tackle Shadow Worlds moving forward.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Romantica was sulking. She had been forced to train right up until yesterday.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to miss your train Miss Romantica. Please don\u2019t delay.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cGot it Pram.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>It was time to go.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cRest well in the upcoming week. We\u2019ll all meet again in the Prilecha Kingdom.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica turned around and left the auditorium without responding to Desir, the sound of her suitcase rolling on the stone floor filled the silence. Romantica walked down the pathway at a slow pace. She continued for quite a distance before turning back to look at Desir. Desir was still standing outside of the auditorium, waving at her.</p>",
    "<p>Romantica called out to him.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou\u2019re dead if you\u2019re late!\u201d</p>"
