    "<p>The streets were filled with vagrants, making it look like a war zone. Knights were deployed to oversee the food distribution and Pram was sweating profusely as he gave orders to his soldiers. The situation was getting dire.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to drive them away in two days anyways, why are we wasting food like this?\u201d said a soldier, expressing the irritation felt by their peers. Others chimed in with their grumbling.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhile I feel bad for them, how can we look after them if we don\u2019t have enough food for ourselves?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou know, I wouldn\u2019t be complaining if we had food to spare. What is the lord thinking, I wonder?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>They weren\u2019t necessarily wrong. People are typically inclined to share only when there is enough to share.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDesir\u2026\u201d Ajest made her way towards Desir. She motioned to reach out to Desir but stopped, her lips pressed tightly. There was nothing that she could say.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat a sheetty feeling,\u201d said Desir. It was a feeling that he had forgotten for a very long time. The feeling of despair, being unable to save someone no matter what you do. The feeling of being powerless to do anything in a helpless situation.</p>",
    "<p>Desir clenched his fists.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Anything is fine. If I can just get one hint\u2026just any help\u2026\u2019</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHave you thought of a solution?\u201d asked Eyulan. She was overseeing the food distribution and,  noticing Desir\u2019s presence, was walking towards him\u2026</p>",
    "<p>\u201cKnight Eyulan,\u201d replied Desir, \u201cyou speak as if you don\u2019t want me to come up with a solution.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cSurely you jest. I may have some opinions of vagrants, but how could I let my personal feelings get in the way when the lord\u2019s territory is at stake? I\u2019m anxiously waiting for our tactician to come up with a reasonable solution.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry. I intend to do so even without you pressing me.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m certain you will, since you are a vagrant yourself.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>That Desir was a vagrant was actually a lie. In order to win over the lord, Desir lied to created an ideal image of himself. However, there was no need to explain this to Eyulan since her opinion of Desir didn\u2019t matter. Additionally, if the lie was exposed, the lord would no longer trust him.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAs a tactician,\u201d continued Eyulan, \u201cyou must understand by now that the only solution is to deport all the vagrants. When it comes time to execute that order, I\u2019ll be sure that all vagrants are expelled without exception.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Eyulan was simply repeating what the lord had said, but there was an emphasis on \u2018no exceptions\u2019.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou say you were kneeling to save others,\u201d said Eyulan, \u201cdon\u2019t make me laugh. In the end, aren\u2019t you kneeling to save yourself? It\u2019s no different than pathetically begging for your life.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>At that moment, Desir grabbed Ajest\u2019s arm. He had barely stopped her from striking Eyulan. Ajest tried to free her arm, but Desir whispered in her ear.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t like you. Don\u2019t be so upset.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI wonder,\u201d continued Eyulan, unaware that she had narrowly avoided a slap to the face, \u201cwhy is every single vagrant so selfish and ego-centric\u2026?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Just then, loud voices could be heard among the vagrants, gradually climbing in volume. A few soldiers were quickly dispatched to deal with the disturbance.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDid you know that an incident like this occurs every hour? The vagrants are trying to steal each other\u2019s rations. How uncivilized.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p>",
    "<p>However, the shouting was still getting louder. More soldiers got deployed and were squeezing their way through the crowd.</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Is it a fight?\u2019</p>",
    "<p>Desir immediately dismissed the thought. Rather than a fight, it looked like the soldiers were trying to stop something. Someone was trying to make their way to Desir and Ajest and the soldiers were blocking the way. It was difficult to see what was going on due to the wall of soldiers around them, but Desir could hear a frustrated voice.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHey, let go of me! I just told you, there is someone I need to talk to over there!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cYou may not approach our tactician.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cBut I know him!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest and Desir shared a blank look. The voice was certainly familiar.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cIs that Romantica?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Ajest nodded and the pair made their way towards the commotion. Curious, Eyulan followed them.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI swear I know them!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHow dare you claim to know them when you\u2019re just a vagrant!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you I\u2019m not a vagrant, you moron!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>As they got closer, Desir was certain that the voice belonged to Romantica.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cLet her go. I do know her.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOh, sir.\u201d The soldier hesitated before stepping aside. In front of them was a young lady.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI told you so!\u201d Upset, Romantica shook her fist at the soldiers before turning towards Desir. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while Desir!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay, Romantica.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOf course! Who do you think I am? I\u2019m Romantica, a third circle mage!\u201d Romantica put her fists on her waist and puffed out her chest in pride. Seeing her brimming with energy, Desir smiled gently.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhere did you end up?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe Kervan Territory, one day\u2019s travel from here by carriage. I cleared my quest over there and then saw the Main Quest, which led me here. However, they said I needed some kind of document to enter the castle? Anyways, now I\u2019m caught up in this mess.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir felt proud of Romantica. She had been able to accomplish a lot by herself.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe situation here looks bad,\u201d continued Romantica, \u201cwhy did the quest progression decline?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Since Romantica was in another territory, she was not aware of the current situation. Desir explained thoroughly to get her caught up. He told her about the large influx of vagrants, which caused the quest progression to decline sharply.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThe situation is looking bad, Romantica.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The biggest problem was food. There simply wasn\u2019t enough to go around.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cPublic opinion of vagrants isn\u2019t too great either. If I don\u2019t come up with a solution in two days, they\u2019ll be kicked out of the territory.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir knew that if that happens, his party would fail the quest. It would be the end.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHm\u2026is that so?\u201d said Romantica, tapping her chin.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cFor the time being, you should rest. It must have been a long trip. I\u2019ll let them know to expect you at the castle,\u201d said Desir considerately. He wanted to let Romantica rest after her long journey. At the same time, he didn\u2019t have a plan to improve the quest progression yet.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019ll gladly accept your offer,\u201d replied Romantica, nodding, \u201cas you can tell, I\u2019m pretty tired. However, is that the only problem we have left to deal with?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWill the vagrant problem be resolved if we solve the food shortage?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir wasn\u2019t sure where Romantica was going with this line of questioning.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cNot completely, but probably most of it. The main reason why we\u2019re driving away the vagrants is because we don\u2019t have enough food.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. No matter what kind of solution we come up with, it\u2019ll be pointless if we still don\u2019t have food.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Having identified the root problem, Romantica crossed her arms and tried hard not to laugh. However, she could not help smiling as she was overjoyed that she had one up over Desir in this situation.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cDid you think of something?\u201d asked Desir.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHaaa? Think of something? Why do you ask?\u201d teased Romantica, savouring the moment, \u201cdo I really need to think of a solution if I already have an answer?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI\u2019ll solve the problem for you. I\u2019ll supply the f-o-o-d.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Desir\u2019s eyes widened. He could not believe his ears.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHow could a nobody like you solve our food shortage?\u201d interrupted Eyulan. It was easy to follow the conversation since Romantica\u2019s voice was loud. Still, it was considered very rude to cut into a private conversation. That Eyulan was doing so implied that she was looking down on both Desir and Romantica. Romantica turned to look at Eyulan with a cold expression.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cA nobody? Who are you to say that?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cI am an honourable knight serving Evernatten. The vice captain Eyulan Lilistick.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cOh, is that so? A noble huh? What a fancy title. No wonder you can talk smack.\u201d</p>",
    "<p>Romantica glared at the knight. It was not a good first impression for either of them.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHow insolent!\u201d roared Eyulan loudly, \u201cWhat did you just say to me?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHey now, listen to me. Didn\u2019t you start it first, old hag? You\u2019re the one calling me a nobody. Do you even know who I am?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>The knight drew her sword in an intimidating fashion, but Romantic merely raised an eyebrow. Her pride would not let her back down. Seeing that, Eyulan lost her composure and faltered. Then, she spoke once again, this time in a quieter voice.</p>",
    "<p>\u201cAren\u2019t you a vagrant?\u201d</p>",
    "<p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you that I\u2019m not a vagrant!? It\u2019s starting to irritate me. I\u2019ve had enough!\u201d</p>",
    "<p>It was at this moment that Desir noticed that Romantica\u2019s clothes were unusual.</p>"
