    "<p>Accelerating.\r</p>",
    "<p>Moving at an extreme speed. The wind whipping past his skin.\r</p>",
    "<p>Desir was blazing forward at incredible speed. He rocketed through the course, deftly avoiding all the obstacles in his way.\r</p>",
    "<p>As the various environments of the Shadow World flashed in and out of view, Desir approached the finish line at breakneck speed. Ajest, who\u2019d looked as small as a dot before, slowly came into view.\r</p>",
    "<p>Even with her tremendous lead, Ajest had kept her wits about her. With her sharp instincts, she had already sensed Desir\u2019s location, estimated his speed, and quickly evaluated the state of affairs. \u2018The fact that the 1st circle mage came this far means that he must have already defeated the 2nd circle mage. It should have been impossible for him to win with magic power, so that leaves two possibilities: either the 2nd circle mage is worthless, or the 1st circle mage is more powerful than the average for his circle.\u2019\r</p>",
    "<p>The latter seemed much more likely\u2014no one could generate that amount of momentum with mere 1st circle magic. This level of acceleration required 3rd circle magic at the very least.\r</p>",
    "<p>This situation completely defied common sense.\r</p>",
    "<p>While looking back at Desir\u2014the source of Ajest\u2019s vexation\u2014her chest started burning with curiosity and a competitive fire. In an instant, she calculated and compared Desir\u2019s speed against her own. \u2018At this rate, he\u2019ll surpass me in less than a minute.\u2019\r</p>",
    "<p>She weighed two potential solutions: \u2018First, use acceleration magic on myself as well.\u2019\r</p>",
    "<p>But she immediately discarded that idea. Even though acceleration magic was a 2nd circle physical-type magic, she would need too much time to reach Desir\u2019s velocity. After all, the gap between their current speed was insurmountable\u2014 even with the help of magic, Desir would definitely overtake her before she could accelerate enough.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u2018That means I have to eliminate him right here.\u2019\r</p>",
    "<p>That was the better plan, and Ajest didn\u2019t hesitate for even a moment before executing it. Magic power emanated from the spellsword, and several magic formulas arranged themselves in front of her in the blink of an eye\u2014and she hadn\u2019t even held her hands out. \u2018If a 1st circle defeated a 2nd circle in skill, he most likely did it through analysis.\u2019\r</p>",
    "<p>Normally, a mage\u2019s ability to analyze an opponent\u2019s spells rose with his or her circle, so that scenario wouldn\u2019t normally happen. But the only possible way for a lower-circle mage to defeat an enemy of a higher circle was through analysis. Of course, though she didn\u2019t know it, her conclusion was spot-on. \u2018If that\u2019s the case...\u2019\r</p>",
    "<p>[I release a cry of sorrow toward my enemies.]\r</p>",
    "<p>[I am the spirit of water. The strongest shield, and the strongest sword.]\r</p>",
    "<p>Hundreds of magic formulas\u2014her magic was on an entirely different level from Romantica\u2019s spell. A beautiful melody rang out in the vast flow of magic power, and six hundred magic circles took shape in the air.\r</p>",
    "<p>[This body is an ocean. Unshaking before countless trespassers. A shower of raindrops.]\r</p>",
    "<p>[I am a wall of flame. The greatest wave, rains of falling flame.]\r</p>",
    "<p>It only took Ajest Kingscrown eight seconds to cast her array of magic. \u2018If your analysis ability is great, then I\u2019ll make my spells even greater.\u2019\r</p>",
    "<p>[Prey of Magic Arrow.]\r</p>",
    "<p>Magic Arrow. It was a spell almost anyone could use\u2014after all, it was only 1st circle-level magic. But the magic that Ajest wielded was another story: she had manifested at least 600 arrows, and they filled the sky above the spellsword.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u2018I used about 15 seconds. But this should be enough.\u2019 This attack would end it: that was Ajest\u2019s conclusion.\r</p>",
    "<p>Desir gaped at the number of magic arrows poised to strike him down. \u2018Amazing. As expected of you, Ajest. Casting so many spells in this short period, you truly possess an incredible talent.\u2019 That was his honest opinion; no one could question Ajest\u2019s skill. Her sheer number of arrows could match the power of a 4th circle mage.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u2018It\u2019s impossible to hijack so many spells in this short time.\u2019 But Desir knew that there was no need to hijack them all. A playful smirk danced on his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re still looking down on me, Ajest.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>[Commence analysis.]\r</p>",
    "<p>Desir closed his eyes and felt the flow of the mana surrounding him. Desir\u2019s thoughts accelerated dozens of times over as he categorized and analyzed Ajest\u2019s magic formulas. \u201cAlbatross\u2019s Embrace, analyzing 180 linked lower magic runes. Complete. Translating Dnerva\u2019s power dampening formula interconnected with the Flidneria system. Hijacking 180 linked lower magic runes. Complete.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>A significant amount of the Magic Arrows floating in the air changed color. With the time he had, the maximum number of Magic Arrows Desir could hijack from Ajest was around 200\u2014but even though that was only a third of the sum total, that number was more than enough.\r</p>",
    "<p>Ajest frowned, realizing she\u2019d lost control over some of her magic. \u2018His analysis speed is abnormally high\u2026 at the level of a 6th circle mage, at least. It\u2019s highly probable that he\u2019ll hijack the rest if given enough time.\u2019\r</p>",
    "<p>Ajest had no more time to spare. She raised her arms upward, then pointed forward\u2014and at her signal, hundreds of Magic Arrows showered towards Desir.\r</p>",
    "<p>The terrifying sound of hundreds of shrieking arrows echoed through the Shadow World. Ajest\u2019s magical formation created what looked like a tidal wave, threatening to drown its adversary. But Desir stood resolutely in the wave\u2019s center, and yelled, \u201cTrajectory adjustment!\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>It was impossible to nullify every single arrow, so Desir decided to knock away only the most dangerous ones instead. Magic Arrow was still only a 1st circle spell, so one or two of them didn\u2019t pose much of a threat. \u2018At the very least, I\u2019ll deflect the most dangerous arrows.\u2019\r</p>",
    "<p>Desir read the velocity of the arrows, the wind, and Ajest\u2019s intentions\u2014and taking all that data, he deduced where each hostile arrow would land. Then he used the arrows he\u2019d taken control over to knock away the lethal ones.\r</p>",
    "<p>Their flight subtly diverted, a number of arrows simply flew past Desir. In this way, he created a path for himself through the gigantic hail of arrows.\r</p>",
    "<p>*Kwak!* \u201cUgh\u2026\u201d But his plan wasn\u2019t flawless.\r</p>",
    "<p>Sharp pain pulsed through Desir\u2019s arms, shoulders, and legs, as stray arrows managed to land a hit on the mage. Even with his best effort, a few arrows still made it past his defense\u2014and the pain slowed Desir down significantly.\r</p>",
    "<p>Ajest was dumbfounded\u2014she had failed to eliminate this measly 1st circle mage. She expected her attack to swiftly eliminate Desir, but\u2026 how was he still alive?\r</p>",
    "<p>\u2018I can\u2019t afford to panic.\u2019 Ajest calmed her breath and gathered her thoughts, returning herself to a state cool-headedness. Once she had gotten rid of her panicked emotions, she calmly read the situation in front of her\u2014and the whole process took her less than a second. \u2018He\u2019s making a path by altering the trajectories of the most dangerous arrows.\u2019\r</p>",
    "<p>Just like Desir had read her magic formulas, Ajest read through his plan. \u2018The reason? The arrows were destroyed. The solution?...\u2019\r</p>",
    "<p>Ajest\u2019s eyes shot back and forth. 21 Magic Arrows remained in the air. Desir had four, she had 17. And there were less than 200 meters left between them\u2014 he would overtake her within five seconds.\r</p>",
    "<p>Ajest manipulated her mana. \u2018Change calculation. Lower the number of arrows, prioritize power and accuracy.\u2019\r</p>",
    "<p>The arrows resonated with her overwhelming magic power. Seven of her remaining 17 arrows lost their form and fused with the rest. Now strengthened, a searing light beamed from the remaining 10 arrows. Each arrow\u2019s individual power was comparable to a 2nd circle spell.\r</p>",
    "<p>Then she adapted her pattern of attack: \u201cChanging operation method.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>The arrows repositioned in the air as if waiting for their commander\u2019s signal. They lined up, head to tail, and arced towards Desir in a single file\u2014much like machine gun fire concentrating on a single point. This time, the arrows hit with much more force than before.\r</p>",
    "<p>With the new arrow formation, Desir knew that if he failed to knock even one of them away, it would be the end. Their power far exceeded the Magic Arrows Desir controlled. \u2018She\u2019s using her head.\u2019\r</p>",
    "<p>Desir shot all of his arrows forward to intercept Ajest\u2019s attack. Using four arrows, he was able to nullify two of hers. But Ajest still had eight Magic Arrows left.\r</p>",
    "<p>However, Desir still had no intention of losing. \u2018You used your head\u2026 but you came up with the wrong answer.\u2019\r</p>",
    "<p>Desir gazed at the incoming arrows, as he began running through more mental calculations. \u201cHijack. Acquired control of four Magic Arrows.\u201d\r</p>",
    "<p>Desir had the capacity to hijack up to 200 arrows before\u2014he\u2019d intentionally left some leeway at the start, not using up all 200. This was his buffer room, so he could negate anything Ajest threw at him.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u2018Deciding to concentrate every arrow onto the same point was too reckless. You should have doubled down on your strategy and increased the number of arrows, even if the power took a hit.\u2019 If she had done so, Desir would have been skewered, judged dead, and disqualified. But thanks to Ajest gathering all the arrows into one spot, Desir could wipe them all out in one fell swoop.\r</p>",
    "<p>\u2018If this was a few years later, you would have found the right answer.\u2019 Judging from Ajest\u2019s tactic, Desir confirmed once more that he was the only one who had returned from the future.</p>"
